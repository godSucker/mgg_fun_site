Not every warrior is a muscle bound brick; lightning reflexes, weapon mastery and more play their part in helping create the ultimate competitor.
caption_specimen_ca_01;This cyborg supercop was retired from active service in the Earthopolis Security force. But in the arena, the fans enjoy its zero tolerance, expeditious judgments and fatal sentencing!

caption_specimen_ea_01;You wouldn’t want this guy to tickle you, but there’s nothing quite like watching him run his diamond tipped blade through somebody else. I got to say I prefer my maid but the planet cleaner does an impressive job of mopping up in the arena.
caption_specimen_eb_01;Tutti gooey! I’ve had ice creams on hot days that have looked more appealing than this… I can’t even use the word guy. I mean is it male, is it female or is it an it!

ftu_facebook_connect;If you started a game already on Facebook, connect now to get your game on this device! Else, close this message and enjoy the game!
ftu_dialog_001;So you decided to take on my offer and become a Psy Captain. Let’s not waste time and get you a team. For today, I’ll pay for you to make it short.
ftu_dialog_002;Mutants are bred in the Breeding Center. Darwin, our scientist, knows all about it. For now, tap on the Breeding Center and then on the Cross Breeding button.
ftu_dialog_003;Mutants need 100% mutosterone to be able to cross breed. Since these two are ready, just tap the cross breeding button.
ftu_dialog_004;Thanks to the gold you received from your sponsors, I was able to reduce the time of the breeding. Tap the Breeding Center again to see the result.
ftu_dialog_005;The lottery will let you know which mutant you got out of this cross breeding.
ftu_dialog_006;Congratulations! You have created your 1st larva! Tap 'Keep it' to incubate it.
ftu_dialog_007;Thanks to gold still, I was able to accelerate the larva’s incubating time. You can now get your new mutant.
ftu_dialog_008;Here, you will learn all about your new creature. But for now, tap 'Retrieve'.
ftu_dialog_009;Now all you have left to do is place it on a compatible compound. They are indicated by arrows. You can also rename it if you want.
ftu_dialog_010;Now, you are ready to fight! So let’s get to it! You have to register for your fight.
ftu_dialog_012;You can review all information about the fights here before you actually fight. Tap the Fight button.
ftu_dialog_013;You need 3 mutants to enter a fight. That’s the rule. I’ve done it for you this time. Now is the time for your first fight!
ftu_dialog_015;You are now in the middle of a fight. The mutants will attack following the order at the top of the screen. It is your turn to attack. Select your attack at the bottom of the screen.
ftu_dialog_016;To select your target, slide a finger on the right hand side off the screen to select one. Slide on all three to try this.
ftu_dialog_017;But you’re not alone in a fight. You can call your friends and myself to help you defeat your opponent. First, select your attack.
ftu_dialog_018;You’re doing great. Now, let’s call your assist. In this case, me. Tap the assist button, then select an attack and a target again. I’ll come to your help.
ftu_dialog_019;Now is the time to collect your reward. Your mutants will gain experience and mutosterone. The first to make them stronger, the second to let you breed more fearsome mutants in the Breeding Center.
ftu_dialog_020;Congratulations! You are now a level 2 Psy captain! As you progress in level, you will gain various items and currencies. You will also unlock new compounds for your mutants.
ftu_dialog_021;Now that you won your first fight, why don’t you go on with the second ?
ftu_dialog_022;You need 3 mutants to enter a fight. Tap on 3 to be ready. Then tap on fight.
ftu_dialog_023;Select an assist if you have any ready. Then start the fight.
ftu_dialog_024;There is another important aspect to fights we have yet to address: strengths and weaknesses. Tap on the sign at the top of the screen.
ftu_dialog_025;Here you see how the different genes interact in terms of strengths and weaknesses. It will help you plan your attacks accordingly.
ftu_dialog_026;Darwin and I will give you missions to accomplish to help you progress. In exchange, you will get rewards in credits or items. Tips are available if you tap on the page corner
ftu_dialog_027;I will now let you continue your way through the fights. Psy-captain, I’m counting on you!
ftu_dialog_028;Your friends can help you in battle like I do through tag team. But for that, you will have first to connect to Facebook.

DialogPVE_0101;Welcome to your new home, Psy-Captain!
DialogPVE_0102;This is a class A Spontaneous Spartan facility, equipped with the latest in mutagenic technology.
DialogPVE_0103;I know you did well on the streets, but this is no gutter lab for hatching pocket-sized monsters.
DialogPVE_0104;Out of these machines will grow the biggest and fiercest biologically engineered gladiators that Earthopolis has ever known.
DialogPVE_0105;But the real test of your metal will come in the arena.
DialogPVE_0106;People with the psionic gift to control mutants are more common than you think. I didn’t pick you for that reason alone!
DialogPVE_0107;You’ve got Mean Genes crawling under your skin, and a passion in your eyes.
DialogPVE_0108;You shall become one of the greatest Psy-Captains Earthopolis has ever known.
DialogPVE_0201;Hey! Trevor! I want you to meet a future star of Mean Genes. I’ve never coached anyone with more potential.
DialogPVE_0202;Eva Destruction. It’s nice seeing you again! I thought you had retired. I don’t have a lot of time…
DialogPVE_0203;I just want you to look at a few vids and see if my Psy-Captain would be good for an interview. Rookie of the week, maybe...
DialogPVE_0204;I'm sorry, Eva. I would love to for old time's sakes, but I've become a busy man. Mean Genes is the most popular show on Earthopolis, and I'm its loudest voice.
DialogPVE_0205;You're Eva Destruction! I was your biggest fan. I cried for days when you were injured...
DialogPVE_0206;Eva, meet Missy... my able-bodied assistant. Don't we have an interview to do... or something, Missy?
DialogPVE_0207;Yes, Mr. Reed. We're actually running a little late. Should I call them...?
DialogPVE_0208;Then we're off. Good luck with your protégé, Eva. And be careful...
DialogPVE_0209;Goodbye, Miss Destruction. It was an honor...
DialogPVE_0210;So much for that connection. It looks like we're going to have to earn your fame the old fashioned way... in the arena.
DialogPVE_0301;I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS! URBAN'S TEAMS DON'T EVEN HAVE TO GO THROUGH QUALIFICATIONS!?! LET ALONE CHERNOBYL!!!
DialogPVE_0302;Calm down, Eva! It's the business. You know how it goes. Fame breeds more fame.
DialogPVE_0303;THIS IS UNFAIR!
DialogPVE_0304;We'll do just fine. We're ready.
DialogPVE_0305;I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!!!
DialogPVE_0306;Let her go and blow off some steam, Psy-Captain. Eva needs some time alone... It's not you... it's Baron Urban. The last time they met in combat was in Chernobyl.
DialogPVE_0307;Eva lost in the final round of the championships defending her title. Alas, she also lost her psionic powers to control Mutants during the fight. Now she can only control few of them.
DialogPVE_0308;She's never fully recovered, but she can't stay away from Mean Genes. That's why she coaches... keeps her close to the arenas.
DialogPVE_0309;She's had other protégés, but you're the best I've seen so far.
DialogPVE_0310;On to Chernobyl! Its arena is the stuff of legends. We'll get to try out some new Zoomorph mutants.
DialogPVE_0351;Ladies, Gentlemen and Free Mutants... the Voice of Mean Genes and the man we've all been waiting for....
DialogPVE_0352;TREVOR REED !!!!
DialogPVE_0353;Thank you, Missy. What a glorious day on Earthopolis... For a Fight!!!!
DialogPVE_0354;<<Applause Applause Applause>>
DialogPVE_0355;On Today's Mean Genes Program we'll be giving you:...
DialogPVE_0356;The Top Ten Super Slams!
DialogPVE_0357;The Top Ten Multi-Attacks!
DialogPVE_0358;And... my favorite... the best Multi-Kill!!!
DialogPVE_0359;Oooh... that's going to hurt.
DialogPVE_0360;You bet, Missy! So stay tuned for another episode of Mean Genes!
DialogPVE_0361;We'll be right back after a quick word from our sponsors!
DialogPVE_0401;I'm impressed! Your popularity is skyrocketing.
DialogPVE_0402;Now that you've survived the Chernobyl qualifying circuit, we can move onto less hazardous and more spectacular fights.
DialogPVE_0403;It's time to show them what your mind is made of in Nu New Delhi!
DialogPVE_0404;Where are we on our Mutant research, Darwin?
DialogPVE_0405;We could always use more space, of course, but what we really need are some new Mutants. Nu New Delhi has some of the most exotic genetic combinations on Earthopolis...
DialogPVE_0406;And experienced Psy-Captains to lead them! To vary our strategies we'll need to keep them on their toes. Not to mention the Global Tournament fights where the competition is going to be stiff.
DialogPVE_0407;I'll keep the laboratory in order, just keep the funding and victories coming in.
DialogPVE_0408;That, we can handle! Come on, Psy-Captain. Your journey to fame and fortune has just taken a nu new turn!
DialogPVE_0451;Here's a breaking Mean Gene's News Ultra-flash from Nu New Delhi! There's an aspiring Psy-Captain climbing up the celebrity ladder... with consecutive victories.
DialogPVE_0452;And it's no wonder! Who's the coach!?
DialogPVE_0453;Why it's none other than the retired Triple Mean Genes Champion, Eva Destruction!
DialogPVE_0454;That is surprising...
DialogPVE_0455;I mean... That's Mean Genes for you! A world where gutter to glory is still possible.
DialogPVE_0456;Catch you all later with another Mean Genes Ultra-flash!
DialogPVE_0501;So wow, it's a great honor to have Baron Urban in with us for a very rare interview. So, how are you?
DialogPVE_0502;Bored Trevor. Bored.
DialogPVE_0503;Bored? But even you must agree this is a great season?
DialogPVE_0504;Well Trevor, let me tell you there are some psy-captains that are showing promise.
DialogPVE_0505;Promise huh?
DialogPVE_0506;But promise of what I'm not sure!
DialogPVE_0507;But in all seriousness Trevor, I feel there's been a lack of real competition in recent years. Not since Eva Destruction have I even felt challenged!
DialogPVE_0508;Well she has a new protege now.
DialogPVE_0509;Yes, I've been watching. They could be of some amusement...
DialogPVE_0510;Well I can say we're all watching you and can't wait for your next fight!
DialogPVE_0601;I've told you Mr. Reed... and I do know who you are. Your offer for an interview was refused categorically. We're too busy.
DialogPVE_0602;But... But no one refuses a Mean Genes interview. Doesn't your Psy-Captain understand what this could mean for sponsorship?
DialogPVE_0603;We are all aware of the viewership of Mean Genes, Mr. Reed.
DialogPVE_0604;Did Eva talk to you about this? She knows what this could mean for your lab...
DialogPVE_0605;Eva tried... a little. But in the end she gave in. It seems you somehow managed to insult her the last time we met, at least according to our Psy-Captain.
DialogPVE_0606;Hmm. Well that's too bad for you. There are other rising stars that can use some publicity.
DialogPVE_0607;Tell Eva, I said hello... And that unlike her, I have a bad memory.
DialogPVE_0701;But Miss Destruction... he's really sorry. I mean as sorry as Mr. Reed can be...
DialogPVE_0702;It's not up to me. I cannot force our Psy-Captain to go to an interview...
DialogPVE_0703;You can't?... I mean. You're Eva Destruction... surely...
DialogPVE_0704;Just tell Trevor...
DialogPVE_0705;Missy... Eva... I've news from our Psy-Captain. The interview is possible under one condition. I've just come from our Psy-Captain.
DialogPVE_0706;What condition is that?
DialogPVE_0707;That Eva is invited to the interview as well. I quote: "Without her, none of these last victories would have been possible." Unquote.
DialogPVE_0708;That's wonderful. I'll go right away.
DialogPVE_0709;Why me? This is not my hour of glory.
DialogPVE_0710;You'll have to take that up with the Psy-Cap. Being famous is not my domain. I'm the Science Guy, remember...
DialogPVE_0801;Thanks for doing this, Eva. I appreciate it. Your protégé has become so popular that I just had to do an interview. It was a question of my reputation...
DialogPVE_0802;Don't thank me. I was against it...
DialogPVE_0803;Ha ha ha... Don't fool me, Eva. You're a professional. You know this is going to bring you in sponsorship.
DialogPVE_0804;Yes. But I was enjoying seeing you sweat.
DialogPVE_0805;Trevor! Eva! It's time. Two minutes. The Psy-Captain is already on the set waiting for you.
DialogPVE_0806;Let's get this show on the road!
DialogPVE_0807;Yes. Feels like old times.
DialogPVE_0901;I... know this sounds strange. But I've just started looking at the Mythic Genes and I think I've figured something out... Some of them have... unethical powers.
DialogPVE_0902;What's that? I've been waiting a decade to get a Mythic Gene strand. There's never even been so much as a debate about ethics on Mean Genes. Baron Urban...
DialogPVE_0903;Urban is exactly the point. The Mythic Gene can be spliced to a human gene strand very easily. I think Urban...
DialogPVE_0904;You think Urban spliced a Mythic Gene strand into his own body?
DialogPVE_0905;It would explain one thing... The loss of your powers. And the sudden increase in his own capacities.
DialogPVE_0906;Explain.
DialogPVE_0907;I think Baron Urban has the power to drain psionic powers from an opponent. I think that's what he did to you. It would be hard to prove.
DialogPVE_0908;I need... to go out and get some fresh air.
DialogPVE_0909;Let her go, Psy-Captain. We're going to get to work. It's time for vengeance.
DialogPVE_1001;I've been thinking about how we can prove Baron Urban managed to drain your powers. To pull it off he needed to be in close proximite to the Mythic mutant he used at the moment he did it.
DialogPVE_1002;If we can just find out which Mutant, I can cross-examine both it and his DNA to prove their is a correlation...
DialogPVE_1003;...But I've been rewatching your final battle with Baron Urban, conveniently the camera cuts away at exactly the right moment.
DialogPVE_1004;Coincidence..?
DialogPVE_1005;I think not, I think someone, other than Urban, knew to distract the camera... that someone being Trevor.
DialogPVE_1006;That jumped-up sack of hair gel! I'm going to wipe that over-dazzled fake smile right off his face.
DialogPVE_1007;Wait! I know you're angry Eva but think, Trevor is our weak link. If we play our cards right we might be able to extract from him the information we need.
DialogPVE_1008;... Ok, I guess that makes sense, but I'm not going to pretend to like him.
DialogPVE_1009;Better not, he might suspect something. OK then Psy-Captain, keep winning those battles and Trevor is sure to come snooping around for another interview. Then we'll strike!
DialogPVE_1101;Hello Eva, would I be permitted to speak with your wonderful protégé again? I want to host a public debate with the two hottest Psy-Captains around.
DialogPVE_1102;The other being Urban I guess.
DialogPVE_1103;Correct. I can just see it now; old vs new, Urban vs Eva... again!
DialogPVE_1104;You'll never let me forget that day will you?
DialogPVE_1105;Not when I remember it so perfectly, both down to your last Mutant. You with your Nebulon, Urban with his Medusa. One of the greatest TV moments in history... oh, probably not for you Eva.
DialogPVE_1106;Not exactly...
DialogPVE_1107;Anyway, places to go and all that but I'll be in touch about the interview! Ciao.
DialogPVE_1108;Medusa... that must have been it. I have to tell Darwin right away, and you keep fighting... we need to keep up appearances. Let's go!
DialogPVE_1201;Now listen carefully Psy-Cap, Darwin said we need a sample of Urban's DNA, hair strand or something...
DialogPVE_1202;... I'm going to ask Missy, she'll have access to Urban's dressing room. I don't if she will help us, but we don't really have another choice.
DialogPVE_1203;Hi Eva, so great to see you, is your protégé ready for his interview?
DialogPVE_1204;Yes, we're ready to go.
DialogPVE_1205;Great, let me know if there is anything else I can help you with Miss Destruction.
DialogPVE_1206;Actually Missy, there is. This may sound crazy but we need a strand of Urban's hair. I don't really have time to explain but it's important.
DialogPVE_1207;What!? Hair... why?
DialogPVE_1208;We think Urban may have had something to do with why I lost my powers, we need the hair strand to prove it. Will you help me Missy?
DialogPVE_1209;I don't know Eva... I could lose my job if they catch me... you really think it's Urban's fault.
DialogPVE_1210;Yes. I do. And I think he could do it again... we need to stop him before he does. What do you say?
DialogPVE_1211;I don't know Eva...I mean, I will try but I can't promise anything.
DialogPVE_1212;Thank you Missy. Let's go Psy-Captain.
DialogPVE_1301;Missy is late, she said to meet outside the studio at 2pm I hope nothing is wrong...
DialogPVE_1302;... I'm not sure how much longer we can wait?
DialogPVE_1303;Hmmm... I don't think she is coming Psy-Cap... I'm sorry to say it but this is a dead end. Let's head back to Darwin, maybe see if we can...
DialogPVE_1304;Eva! Wait... I'm here, I made it. Sorry I'm late, I came as quickly as I could.
DialogPVE_1305;Missy... I was beginning to think you weren't going to show up. Did you get it?
DialogPVE_1306;Yes... I snuck into Urban's dressing room once he left, I took a hair from his comb, will this be enough?
DialogPVE_1307;This will be perfect Missy. Thank you so much for your help.
DialogPVE_1308;Come on Psy-Cap, let's get this to Darwin straight away.
DialogPVE_1401;So Darwin... did you check Urban's DNA? Was it a match with the Mutant's? Please tell me you found out something useful.
DialogPVE_1402;I was able to take a sample of DNA from the strand of hair Missy got for us and cross compare the strand against the supposedly extracted Mutant DNA and comparatively determine...
DialogPVE_1403;Darwin! You use too many words. Just tell me if it was a match or not, my nerves can't take this.
DialogPVE_1404;It was a match, this is proof. And not only that I think... I'm not sure, but if Baron Urban really did splice a strand of Mutant DNA with his own then theoretically he could be controlled by a Psy-Captain.
DialogPVE_1405;What?! So we could make him confess on live TV? Tell everyone what he did to me?
DialogPVE_1406;In theory... but Eva it would take an incredibly powerful Psy-Captain to do this. As good as your protégé is he has nowhere near the skill and strength to pull this off.
DialogPVE_1407;Not yet maybe... but he will. Psy-Captain it's up to you. I don't have the power anymore to take on Urban, but you do. What do you say? Will you help me?.
DialogPVE_Event_0101;Are you ready for a new challenge?
DialogPVE_Event_0102;Welcome to Miami for the very first event of the season!
DialogPVE_Event_0103;During the 21st century, Miami was devastated by global warming, making its iconic beach dry and deserted for several decades. But thanks to the latest research of the engineers from...
DialogPVE_Event_0104;Darwin, always telling stories... We don't have time for this!
DialogPVE_Event_0105;Well, ok... Psy Captain, time to test your abilities by fighting tougher and tougher enemies! The more you progress in the event, the more interesting your rewards will be!
DialogPVE_Event_0106;But be careful, if you lose, you'll fall back to the previous step!
DialogPVE_Event_0107;Eva, Trevor, Psy Captain, hurry up, the audience is going crazy!
DialogPVE_Event_0108;Psy Captain, time to show them who's the best!
DialogPVE_Event_0109;Awesome! You managed to overcome all the mutant teams of our Beach Clash Miami event!
DialogPVE_Event_0110;Congratulations Psy Captain, you stood up against all the mutants you faced during the event!
DialogPVE_Event_0111;It has been a long time since I’ve seen such merciless fights!
DialogPVE_Event_0112;I heard that Baron Urban crushed all his opponents in less than 2 days...
DialogPVE_Event_0113;Stop ruining the party Darwin!
DialogPVE_Event_0114;See you very soon for a new event! One point though: do not get used to the Miami sun! Till then, keep up the good work!
DialogPVE_Event_0201;A new tournament is here…Are you ready???
DialogPVE_Event_0202;Oh yes, Trevor!

DialogPVE_Event_0312;Congratulations!

DialogPVE_Event_0403;Then welcome to Baron Urban's Mars tournament!!
DialogPVE_Event_0411;You've beaten my monsters and won all the rewards, congratulations...
DialogPVE_Event_0412;Congratulations!

DialogPVE_Event_0501;Do you want Fame, Fun and Fortune in the same time?

explainMap1;Motor City stories are told that in the 20th Century Detroit was a star of the then United States industrial foundation. A pillar of the global economy with it’s popular ‘automobiles’, now all that remains are the bones of that golden age. Rusted relics, defining a petroleum based society. When demand stopped and the workers were laid off, no one told the machines. Factories continued to spit out the metal frames, until the Detroit became the ‘elephant’s graveyard’. A mythical landscape filled with the split carcasses of cars and trucks.
explainMap2;After the economic collapse and the second civil war in the US most of the power brokers moved to Mexico city under the invitation of the governing cartel. Mexico City had always been a city divided by its richest and poorest inhabitants but under the Cartels and Corporations it became a truly segregated environment with the poor living in ‘The Basura’ under the shadow of the trash-mountains and the gas volcanoes. But thanks to the games they are too distracted to rise above the squalor they now live in. One day the people will rise. The dissident voices cry out for justice…
explainMap3;For the briefest moment India was the economic star of the world before the global collapse. During the market turmoil India suffered from a wave of natural disasters, Delhi was hit by a seemingly never ending monsoon season and much of the city was submerged. Though the rains are no longer continuous Nu Delhi has become the Venice of the East!
explainMap4;The final city in the outer league arena, a fitting venue for the mutant arenas! There are some that say this is where it all began. Not everyone left after the disaster; many locals stayed surviving in the crumbling tenements and reverting to a more savage nature as the radiation took its toll over the generations. Pit fights were a common form of entertainment in their subterranean arenas pitting the most deformed and mutated against each other. The old fairground is still a haunting reminder of those unsanctioned days and iconic to those fans of the arena.
explainMap5;By the mid-twenty first century Shanghai had become the business hub of the new global economy. If a deal was worth doing it went down here, with little to no oversight it was perfect for the early gene dealers to ply their trade.
explainMap6;Nobody embraced the gene arenas like the residents of Japan. The national subconscious was already bathed in kaiju culture, so that when the arenas began the residents of Tokyo trampled each other underfoot in the rush to tickets!
explainMap7;Originally the ultimate tourist destination, now one of Earths most spectacular arenas and the beginning of the premier league. The shocking discovery of the fabled underwater metropolis by Gene-Corp in the late 21st Century not only opened a whole new avenue of research due to the unique eco-system but also the curiosity of world!
explainMap8;Paris city of lights and home to the floating neon stadium for the penultimate stages of Gene Arena! High above the city, fans can see Paris as it was meant to be scene from the glory of the old to the wonder of the new. But all eyes are fixed on the arena floor, for it these matches that will determine who moves on to the finale!
explainMap9;Cairo, always the jewel of the Nile but now thanks to Gene Arena it has regained an older name. The Triumphant City! Here among the ancient testaments to man’s ingenuity and strength; this is where mortals become gods and gain immortality in the minds of the world on the arena floor! To have risen here they are already heroes, but nothing can have prepared them for this. The final bloody battles to decide who is the ultimate champion of Gene Arena!

txt_PVE_Map_01;The Hasta Lucha Dome located in the heart of sprawling Mexicopolis, has become an obligatory stop for Psy-Captains with guts enough to pit their Mutants against pure animal fury.
txt_PVE_Map_02;Chernobyl! This is where it all began. The first recorded Mutant fights were staged here. Your own Mutants are in for the fights of their lives in the radioactive arena of the Nuclear Field House.
txt_PVE_Map_03;Nu New Delhi is not only famous for its food, but its magical floating arena, sponsored by Liquid Nirvana euphorical beverages. Win fights here and your Psy-Captain reputation will ascend to the heavens.
txt_PVE_Map_04;Shorline Shanghai's HyperBollical Gardens were designed for the Olympic Games, cancelled due to the growing popularity of Mean Genes. It's now the perfect venue for Psy-Captains with panache.
txt_PVE_Map_05;Nobody embraced the gene arenas like the residents of Neo-Tokyo. The national subconscious bathed in kaiju culture literally trampled each other underfoot in the rush for tickets!
txt_PVE_Map_06;Set amongst the fabled ruins of the submerged city, the Atlantic arena and research center is a fitting start for those who have made it to the Premier League.

DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_1a;That's weird... The Lab's usually much more hectic at that time.
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_1b;Isn't it that there's no trouble at all, for once, in your Lab?
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_1c;No need to be ironic, Eva. I have a bad feeling, something's not right...
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_1d;Engaging Procedure 64-23
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_1e;What's happening this time, Darwin!
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_1f;I don't know! I have no Procedure 64 in my machines!
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_1g;In any case, there's a lot of noise outside. Psy Captain, follow us!
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_2a;Ok, we succeeded in overcoming the Cyber Mutants, now everything should go back to normal.
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_2b;Bad news, Eva, looks like Cyber Mutants aren't the only ones to rebel.
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_2c;The Galactic Mutants are going berserk too!
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_2d;There can be only one person behind all this.
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_2e;Let's take care of the Mutants and then we'll pay him a visit.
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_2f;Ready to get back to it, Psy Captain?
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_3a;Urban! As always, you're the one at the centre of trouble!
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_3b;What did you do so that Cyber and Galactic Mutants attack the population?
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_3c;Not now Eva! I have enough trouble on my own for now with Necro Mutants without having to put up with your sarcasms!
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_3d;Then recall your troop of degenerate mutants and explain yourself!
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_3e;If it was that easy, it'd be already done!
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_3f;By the way, maybe you could get down to it, so that we can stay alive and finish this conversation!
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_4a;All right, now let's talk. But don't waste my time!
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_4b;First, the Cyber attack in the Lab.
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_4c;Then, the Galactic Mutants who attempt an invasion.
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_4d;And now, Necro Mutants wrecking the city. And who's there? You, of course!
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_4e;If I had the opportunity, of course I'd have found a way to release my necros in the redhead's lab.
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_4f;Of course...
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_4g;So you admit that you're the one behind it! Hey, are you listening to me?
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_4h;The only thing I'm admitting is that the Mexico arena will not hold for long if the Mythic Mutants keep assaulting it!
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_4i;Come on Psy-Captain, he won't get away this easily!
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_5a;Urban! Will you tell us why you're doing this?
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_5b;What about you, will you tell us why it has to be me?
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_5c;Since the beginning, I'm bending over backwards to get rid of these crazy Mutants, but it's not enough, if Eva Destruction thinks I'm the one responsible!
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_5d;Wait, are you saying that...
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_5e;That I have nothing to do with all this, indeed. But I'd like to know who did this and how as much as you.
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_5f;That's what we're trying to find out too.
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_5g;There are not many places left. Let's head to Shangai, there are other issues with the Saber Mutants there!
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_5h;I don't like to listen to Urban, but for once, he might just be right. Come on, Psy-Captain, we have a lot on our plate!
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_6a;Are you all right, Psy-Captain? Urban! What was that thing?
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_6b;From his size and what he did, I'd say an ultra-powerful mutant... But he doesn't look like anything I know.
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_6c;What about the Mutodex Data? Darwin?
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_6d;Let me look. I don't see anything at all about him...
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_6e;Wait! There's an encrypted file about an experimental mutant using the power of gravitational singularities in combat.
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_6f;Using what?
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_6g;A mutant using the energy of black holes. There's no doubt that it's him.
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_6h;And who could have created such a dangerous mutant? He has devastated an entire arena!
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_6i;There's no info about it in the file, but now that I'm thinking about it... And seeing what's going on, I'm starting to have some idea about it. We have to capture this mutant!
DialogPVE_Event_Anniv_6j;He went straight underwater... Psy Captain, let's head to Atlantis!
nobody;???
dialog_comp;Psy Captain, as a compensation for the recent issues that happened during the event, here's a little gift for you.
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween_Test;Coucou !
specimen_A_01_stand;ZeRobot
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween_Intro_1;Greetings, Psy Captain. My name is Acheron, but I am generally called the Merchant of Souls. I have here a range of goods that may be of interest to you while you are rising to the top... for a price, of course.
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween_Intro_2;As you've probably guessed, I don't use... traditional currency to trade. What I'm looking for is this type of item [icon/halloween_soul#20x20], I'm giving you one so that you can easily recognize them...
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween_Intro_3;I'd also need your help to solve some minor issues with some of my former... "soul collectors". Don't worry, this is right up your alley.
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween_Intro_4;If you'd like to start, I'll be waiting for you near the Exchange Office.
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween_Pt1_1;As I told you, I need your help to retrieve what has been stolen from me by my former soul collectors, in other words, their lanterns.
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween_Pt1_2;The first of them is named Jack. Unfortunately, he made the very bad move to run away after having collected a lot of souls in his lantern, thus putting an end to an excellent collaboration.
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween_Pt1_3;It would seem that he is hidden deep inside a cemetery full of old and decrepit mutants.
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween_Pt1_end;Very well, my first lantern is in my hands again. Keep the souls that were in it, I'm probably the only one interested in buying them anyway...
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween_Pt2_1;The second soul collector is much more... disturbing. Our agreement allowed him to consume half of the souls, as long as he would give me the other half. But he was such a big eater that he'd rather flee with the second lantern to capture souls for himself.
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween_Pt2_2;Just like for Jack, I want you to bring my lantern back and I'll allow you to keep (or exchange) the souls that were in it.
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween_Pt2_end;At last, my second lantern! I can see that this wasn't a difficult task for you. It is time to find new, more reliable, collectors, I guess. Anyway, thanks for your help.
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween_Pt2_end2;If you'd still like to exchange a few souls, I'm still here for a limited amount of time. So, feel free to do it!

DialogPVE_Event_Xmas18_Intro_1;Hi, Psy Captain! Christmas has finally arrived, and it’s time for us to celebrate with a-
DialogPVE_Event_Xmas18_Intro_2;SNOWBALL FIGHT!
DialogPVE_Event_Xmas18_Intro_3;Darwin! What was that for?  
DialogPVE_Event_Xmas18_Intro_4;Sorry, I didn’t mean to interrupt you… I just thought a snowball fight would be a fun way to end this year, after everything that happened to us. Psy Captain, can you bring us a lot of snowballs? 
DialogPVE_Event_Xmas18_Intro_5;Fine, but let’s hope there won’t be any problem… And that Urban will not do something stupid about that snowball fight idea.
DialogPVE_Event_Xmas18_Pt1_1;Psy Captain! We’re in dire trouble: someone has decided to ruin the Christmas holiday for everyone. Urban, do you know something? 
DialogPVE_Event_Xmas18_Pt1_2;I wouldn’t want to miss my gifts, Eva! Don’t you think it could be some angry mutant, once again trying to ruin the fun for everyone? 
DialogPVE_Event_Xmas18_Pt1_3;That would explain the mutants trying to destroy Christmas trees and decorations… Let’s find out who’s behind this!
DialogPVE_Event_Xmas18_Pt1_4;As I was saying earlier, there is a Christmas-ruining mutant and it is none other than Grumpy Claus! Whatever, go and subdue that fake Santa!
DialogPVE_Event_Xmas18_Pt2_1;Psy Captain, we thought Grumpy Claus was the only problem, but it appears that there an anomaly, trying to disturb all security networks. 
DialogPVE_Event_Xmas18_Pt2_2;We can’t let that happen, or else, most of our systems could break down, and many mutants would roam freely around the world, able to attack people! 
DialogPVE_Event_Xmas18_Pt2_3;Psy-Captain, try to hold back all these mutants, while I’m looking into who’s behind this hacking attempt!
DialogPVE_Event_Xmas18_Pt2_4;Right, I found it! It wasn’t an anomaly, but An0maly, that small, cyber-implanted otter mutant! It’s probably still in one of the labs! Find it, before it creates a new year-transition major bug! 
DialogPVE_Event_Easter19_1;Hello, Psy Captain! It is now time to start the Easter hunt! But, this time, Darwin has hidden special chocolates!
DialogPVE_Event_Easter19_2;Try to find as many as possible before they melt in the sun! 
DialogPVE_Event_Easter19_3;It even seems that one can trade them in the exchange office to et a chocolate mutant!
DialogPVE_Event_Easter19_4;Hey, Eva, that's not the sole usefulness of these chocolates!
DialogPVE_Event_Easter19_5;Isn't it? Do you mean we can eat them too?
DialogPVE_Event_Easter19_6;No, I would advise against eating them. However, you can give them to a mutant to increase its power.
DialogPVE_Event_Easter19_7;The Chocobase [icon/material_easter_2019_chocobase#20x20] are the smallest chocolates.
DialogPVE_Event_Easter19_8;The Chocoplus [icon/material_easter_2019_chocoplus#20x20] are more refined chocolates and give more experience!
DialogPVE_Event_Easter19_9;Les Chocobase [icon/material_easter_2019_chocomax#20x20] sont les plus petits chocolats.
DialogPVE_Event_Easter19_10;DARWIN, HIT HARD!
DialogPVE_Event_Easter19_11;Hahaha! What an idiot!
DialogPVE_Event_Easter19_12;You know very well it's not his fault.
DialogPVE_Event_Easter19_13;Whatever, it's still funny to me. In any case, now that Darwin's gone, his chocolate stocks are probably going to be looted by greedy mutants!  
DialogPVE_Event_Easter19_M1;BUFFALOR, DESTROYED! HAHAHA!
DialogPVE_Event_Easter19_M2;At least, this fool can sometimes be useful, when he is in this state. Let's take advantage of the opportunity to go deeper in the lab. 
DialogPVE_Event_Easter19_E1;What was that thing, Darwin? Are you experiencing on chocolate mutants now?
DialogPVE_Event_Easter19_E2;Errr... Sorry... But I only experimented with improved chocolates, not with chocolate mutants...
DialogPVE_Event_Easter19_E3;(so "he" could be the one who created it... No way I'm telling it to those two...)
DialogPVE_Event_Easter19_E4;Ah, Psy Captain, I didn't see you there. You didn't hear anything, did you?

DialogPVE_Event_halloween19_1_1;Brr... I hate this time of the year...
DialogPVE_Event_halloween19_1_2;But it's a good time to have fun!
DialogPVE_Event_halloween19_1_3;BOO!
DialogPVE_Event_halloween19_1_4;No Urban, this won't work!
DialogPVE_Event_halloween19_1_5;Still... It's a sinister celebration.
DialogPVE_Event_halloween19_2_1;Aaaah! What's this misty and translucent thing! Is it one of your pranks, Urban?
DialogPVE_Event_halloween19_2_2;No, I'd like to know what it is too.
DialogPVE_Event_halloween19_2_3;Very well then, that's a good reason to stay in my lab!
DialogPVE_Event_halloween19_3_1;The sword...
DialogPVE_Event_halloween19_3_2;What? Who is speaking?
DialogPVE_Event_halloween19_3_3;Find... the sword...
DialogPVE_Event_halloween19_3_4;What sword?
DialogPVE_Event_halloween19_3_5;Banshees... Stolen sword... Danger...
DialogPVE_Event_halloween19_3_6;Hold on, we're going to take care of you!
DialogPVE_Event_halloween19_4_1;Thank you. I thought I was going to perish.
DialogPVE_Event_halloween19_4_2;Let me introduce myself: I am Caliburn, knight-errant! But is one still a knight when one has lost his weapon? 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween19_4_3;Knight... What? But the year is 2319! There are no more knights anymore!
DialogPVE_Event_halloween19_4_4;Excuse me? Then I have no more king to serve?
DialogPVE_Event_halloween19_4_5;Is my existence meaningless?
DialogPVE_Event_halloween19_4_6;Were all my feats in battle mere futilities?
DialogPVE_Event_halloween19_4_7;Maybe not! Psy Captain, you could use a good fighter in your team, right?
DialogPVE_Event_halloween19_4_8;Only if you are worthy... and if I get my sword back.
DialogPVE_Event_halloween19_2b_1;Trials... Complete the trials...

DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_1_1;Don't you think it's getting dark this year for Christmas?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_1_2;No wonder it's getting dark, snow has been mixed to soot!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_1_3;But nobody uses coal anymore these days! This is unusual.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_1_4;This is, indeed, *unusual*.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_1_5;Wait, do you think it's him again?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_1_6;What do you think? He's been the source of more than half of our issues...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_1_7;The odds of him being behind all this are... far from negligible.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_2_1;*POW*
DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_2_2;Who threw this snowball at me?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_2_3;No more nice Christmas with fatty! Let's fight!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_2_4;I'LL HAVE MY REVENGE!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_2_5;A mutant? A new creation of Mutenstein?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_2_6;Looks like it, doesn't it? Something bad-tempered, hungry for revenge... This is his style.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_2_7;Let's be careful, there may be more.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_3_1;Payback time!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_3_2;Payback for what exactly?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_3_3;PAYBACK TIME I SAY!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_3_4;NOOOOO! Not again! This is not over!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_3_5;This thing is utterly crazy!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_3_6;Just like Mutenstein...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_4_1;You again? Let's try it this way...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_4_2;This doesn't make sense! This creature has managed to switch its combat parameters on its own, just like that!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_4_3;I'm not giving up! NEVER!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_4_4;The more it goes on, the more I wonder if he really is linked to Mutenstein...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_4_5;What do you mean? His hunger for revenge isn't enough to convince you?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_4_6;Well... Not really.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_4_7;I'm more under the impression that this is an entity which wants to ruin Christmas for everybody.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_5_1;This time, let's mix it up a bit...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_5_2;WHY ISN'T IT WORKING? WHYYYYYY?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_5_3;Because we're going to prevent you to do what you want with Christmas.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_6_1;Speed OK, Power OK, Resistance OK. Ready for battle?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_6_2;We don't have a choice! Psy Captain?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_6_3;AH! I know what I have to do!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_7_1;HAHA! Witness my final form!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas19_7_2;And... What's different this time?

caption_mission0003;There's a mutant I think you should try that can really help in a pinch.
caption_mission0004;There's a mutant that's a good way to scare the genetic aftermath out of someone. It's an important addition to any arsenal.
caption_mission0005;Get one of these and your opponent won't know what hit him!
caption_mission0006;She may seem a little cold, but this mutant will definitely shock your opponents!
caption_mission0007;If you want to drain your opponents dry, this duke of darkness is just the thing!
caption_mission0008;To crush your opponents before you and hear the lamentations... well you know the drill
caption_mission0009;We need to build a Zoomorph Compound, then we can really unleash the animal inside you!
caption_mission0010;We have the Zoomorph Gene, so we need to buy a Beast Larva and start Cross-Breeding!
caption_mission0011;I wouldn't like to find one of these in the garden, but in the arena...
caption_mission0012;Sometimes the most unholy alliances, breed winning combinations...
caption_mission0013;They say we cater for all tastes at the arena, she's sweet but she packs a punch!
caption_mission0014;Sometimes not everything is as it seems; beware this Kitty has claws!
caption_mission0015;The competition is out of this world and we need to keep pace; better build a Galactic Compound.
caption_mission0016;Now that we have the GALACTIC gene, purchase an Alien and start Cross-Breeding.
caption_mission0017;A cosmic oddity that packs more than a punch; The heavens will literally rain on your enemies!
caption_mission0018;The origins of this space specter are still classified, all you need to know is your opponents' defeats will haunt them forever!
caption_mission0019;There's life out there, but not as we know and that's good for ratings!
caption_mission0020;This is one 'lady' that has no qualms on hitting on you or your opponents!
caption_mission0021;There are many mysteries in the universe, but the only one that should concern you is how do I beat the next guy?
caption_mission0022;We're facing some legendary fighters now; time to build a Mythic Compound.
caption_mission0023;Now that you have the Mythic Gene strand, buy a Demon, and start Cross-Breeding!
caption_mission0024;You ever felt machines were playing with you, had a mind of their own? This guy will bring more than that feeling to your opponent!
caption_mission0025;Nobody does that hoodoo, voodoo like you do kid. Now mix me a mutant!
caption_mission0026;This lovely lady can rain pain from above; it's time to get some air support!
caption_mission0027;Everyone knows you can get your finger burnt playing with fire. So why don't we turn your opponents to toast?
caption_mission0028;This mutant blends two of the strangest genes in your arsenal, creating a glimpse of maybe what's beyond the gateway...
caption_mission0029;Fear and fire, two of the most important weapons in your arsenal. The Pit Lord has both in abundance, mix one up and lets see if your opponents fancy a game of devil in the dark!
caption_mission0030;This creature would give us a tremendous advantage in the arena. Let's make it happen.

caption_mission0045;The zoning permits have come through and we can now upgrade our Compounds. The fans are going to love it and we need the room.
caption_mission0046;The Beasts are getting restless in their Compound. It's time to give them some breathing room.
caption_mission0047;Finally, we've got the zoning permit to Upgrade our Compounds! Let's get to it.
caption_mission0048;The Beasts could use a Mega Compound. The good news is that we can now build or upgrade one.
caption_mission0049;The Aliens could use some company. The first thing to do is to increase the size of the Galactic Compound.
caption_mission0050;We need to increase the size of the Galactic Compound, Psy-Captain. The Alien's need more room for their mind games.
caption_mission0051;We need to upgrade the Mythic Compound. It's getting weird in there!
caption_mission0052;A Mega Compound is needed if you wish to keep expanding your Mythic Mutants.
caption_mission0067;Psy-Captain! It's time to take the stage. Fight and you'll become famous. Do nothing and your reputation will gather dust.
caption_mission0068;You just unlocked a new gene. In order to be able to start cross-breedings, we need the basic mono-strand Mutant. We need to buy it.
caption_mission0069;Psy-Cap! We're bumping elbows with each other down here and one of our technicians nearly got stepped on by a Mutant. We really need some more space.
caption_mission0070;You just unlocked a new gene! You need to buy the corresponding compound in order for us to house the new types of Mutants.
caption_mission0071;Psy-cap! The mutants are taking some damage, but I could make some things to speed up their recovery if I had a Med Lab.
caption_mission0072;You need to test the Med Lab right away. If you place an order, we can start manufacturing some healing fluids.
caption_mission0073;No need to wait to heal up a Mutant. A quick heal is always an option.
caption_mission0074;If Eva has got you in a hurry to Cross-Breed and find new Mutants we can use artificial Mutosterone for a few Gold. It is just as effective as the natural Mutosterone.
caption_mission0075;If you make the effort to send Free Gifts to your friends, they'll be extremely likely to send gifts back to you in return.
caption_mission0117;At least two of your Mutants have sufficient Mutosterone to be Cross-Bred. It is time to put them in the Breeding Center.
caption_mission0118;Let's speed this Cross-Breeding up. We need new Mutants in the arena. Our sponsors and fans are growing impatient.
caption_mission0119;Let's finish this up quickly. Let's also accelerate the Incubation.
caption_mission0120;It's time to go out into the Mean Genes Arena and test your skills against other Psy-Captains in the Global Tournament.
caption_mission0129;Congratulations your Mutant has reached level 5, unlocking a new attack. Keep gaining experience to power up your Mutants!
caption_mission0130;That's nice, Eva, but our Mutants will be limited to level 5 if we don't upgrade the Evolution Center.
caption_mission0131;We need to invest funds to Improve the Evolution Center. This will allow our Mutants to reach higher levels.
caption_mission0133;Each Mutant gladiator we train attracts its own fans, and brings in funds. Don't forget to click on the compounds from time to time to collect.
caption_mission0134;It's time we showed our Psy-Captain how to access the Mutant Database.
caption_mission0135;Here you go, Psy-Captain. Click here to look into the Mutopedia. All our test data has been stored there.
caption_mission0136;Fantastic! One of your Mutants attacks is now upgraded. This more powerful attack replaces the original. Upgraded attacks are marked with a plus symbol next to the Gene. Time to spread the pain!
caption_mission0143;This is going to be a challenge. This next Mutant I've lined up is truly a monster, but if you can defeat it and scrape some of its DNA off our Mutant's matter we can acquire the gene strand for our laboratory.
caption_mission0144;We could make good use of the Galactic Gene strand in our laboratories. I've lined up this next battle with that in mind. Defeat this Alien monstrosity and we'll have it.
caption_mission0145;This is going to be one tough fight, but I believe in you. You can win this fight and in doing so, acquire the Mythic Gene.
caption_mission0152;We need to accelerate the compound you've just bought because our new creature should soon be ready
caption_mission0153;The new creature you've just bought will be perfect to make a versatile team: we can't wait its incubation, we need it NOW!

tips_mission_anniversary19_pt1_1;You will find them by fighting in the PvE event.
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt1_1;Psy-Captain! Things are becoming dire around here… There are reports of people going missing everywhere on Earth. And there are some weird black shards…
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt1_2;We need to find Darwin, so that he could find out what happened! Hopefully, there won’t be that many things on our path before reaching him… 
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt1_3;We’d better keep those shards around, so that he could analyse them.
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt1_4;It seems that also happened to buildings and labs… Oh great! More mutants starting to break out from labs… Security really needs to be improved…
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt1_5;Look! Floating atop that building, it looks like a mutant! Let’s go and fight it before it completely destroys the city!
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt1_6;These shards really are everywhere! It was a good thing to collect them before seeing Darwin… Oh wait! There he is!
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt1_7;Ah, Eva! Glad you’re both safe! I heard about the disappearances.
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt1_8;Nice, we won’t have to explain it to you then! How about the black shards?
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt1_9;Black shards? Hmmm… Do you have one, so that I could analyse it?
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt1_10;Take this one. Will it take long?
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt1_11;Well, a few days at most.
caption_reach70_obj1;Win the 70th fight of the current Event
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt2_1;So, Darwin, did you find out what these black shards were?
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt2_2;These are crystallized shards of dark matter. A double matrix of silicon and dark matter. It explains their appearance, durability and color.
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt2_3;And these are the source of the problems we faced!
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt2_4;Well, things are not that easy. Dark matter, especially in that form, doesn’t have such properties.
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt2_5;What about the people, then?
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt2_6;I wanted to confirm exactly what happened with the disappearances. So, thinking these people had been teleported elsewhere due to advanced tech, I just launched a tracking device.
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt2_7;Until I have results, you can help people deal with the free-roaming mutants.
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt2_8;Eva. I have some news…
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt2_9;And? It seems you’re unhappy with the results…
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt2_10;More upset than unhappy. The tracker, and most probably the missing persons, have been erased from reality!
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt2_11;WHAT? How can this be?
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt2_12;Even though I dislike him, I might need Urban’s help analyzing the data to come up with a good answer.
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt2_13;Let’s go to his crafting lab then! We’ll lose less time that way.
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt2_14;Surrender to the absolute nothingness…
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt2_15;Did that mutant… talk?
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt2_16;In our minds, yes! But it means we’ll need you to fight it and defend us, Psy Captain!
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt2_17;Darwin, what’s that thing that dropped when this mutant was defeated?
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt2_18;It’s weird… It looks like another crystalline matrix, but it’s definitely not Dark Matter. But it’s unbelievably heavy.
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt2_19;So? Do you have an idea?
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt2_20;No. I can only tell how it was made: by combining a lot of dark matter in a black hole. It might work with the Dark Matter you’ve accumulated, Psy Captain!
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt3_1;One word: Antimatter. A combination of Dark Matter shards in a singularity. Seven shards in my Black Hole should be enough to create other Antimatter crystals.
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt3_2;Antiwhat? Isn’t it just some scientific explanation to shut us up?
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt3_3;Not really, Eva. Antimatter is, well, the antithesis of reality. You combine antimatter with matter, and boom, both vanish into nothingness.
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt3_4;That’s… horrible!
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt3_5;And if someone’s using it as a weapon… They’re really up to no good. Like, for example, destroying Earth and its inhabitants.
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt3_6;No time to lose then!
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt3_7;Really? It starts being exhausting, fighting all these mutants. Isn’t there a faster way to find the source of this antimatter, or whatever you call it?
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt3_8;We’re trying to triangulate the emissions, applying a probabilistic model to detect the source… But we still need more time, or we might go to the wrong place.
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt3_9;There we are, the location of the antimatter-emitting source…
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt3_10;What is that weird thing? Is that… a mutant?
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt3_11;Behind you!
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt3_12;What the…
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt3_13;You’re okay, Eva? Urban, how did you know?
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt3_14;I know that attack pattern. “He” taught me, a while ago. And if that attack pattern is back… it means that “he” is really back…
dialog_anniversary_2019_pt3_15;I didn’t want to believe it, but we have to face the truth. Mutenstein is alive, and as demented as ever…

dialog_intro_mutenstein_1;Professor Karl Otto Mutenstein. Doctor of Physical Sciences, Genetics, Biology, Organic Chemistry...
dialog_intro_mutenstein_2;...Psychology, Cognitive Science, Behavioral Science...
dialog_intro_mutenstein_3;...Nuclear Physics and Astronomy. I also allowed the synchronization of humans and mutants, through the extraction and analysis of mutosterone.
dialog_intro_mutenstein_4;As you may have noticed, I have recently acquired the rights to access the annual meeting circuit. And I've made it a little... better.
dialog_intro_mutenstein_5;For my new experiment, I need to acquire data under... special experimental conditions.
dialog_intro_mutenstein_6;Please understand that I cannot check data and direct mutants at the same time.
dialog_intro_mutenstein_7;I see you have more potential than my last... assistant. Then you should be able to survive the process.
dialog_intro_mutenstein_8;Rest assured, you will be rewarded for your contribution to the evolution of mankind.
tutorial_intro_incubator_1;Your (GENE) larva must be placed in an incubator if you want it to develop:
tutorial_rush_incubator_1old;Well Done! Click on the incubator to accelerate incubation time.
tutorial_confirm_incubator_1;Click "Yes" to instantly accelerate incubation.
tutorial_open_shop_1;Incubation is complete!\n Now you'll need a habitat for your (SPECIMEN). Click on the "Shop" to pick it up!
tutorial_buy_habitat_1;Your (SPECIMEN) should be placed in a (GENE) habitat type.\n\nClick "Buy" to get it.
tutorial_open_incubator_1;Perfect! Click on the incubator to display its interface.
tutorial_collect_incubator_2;And there we have it. A Mutant ready for the arena and mentally linked to follow your psychic commands.
tutorial_place_specimen_1;Each compound was designed for a specific mutant gene. If not housed correctly they would tear each other apart and the city!
tutorial_select_specimen_2;Nice job! Your mutant might start to feel lonely. Let's find him a battle partner!\nOpen the Shop in the "Specimen" section
tutorial_buy_specimen_2;Buy the second available larva:
tutorial_place_incubator_2;Let's put it in the incubator.
tutorial_open_incubator_2;Retrieve your (SPECIMEN) once it reaches adult size.\nYou understand how it all works now... Right?
tutorial_confirm_incubator_2;Click "Yes" to accelerate. You're almost there!\n I can't wait to see what it looks like!
tutorial_collect_incubator_1;Select the Incubator. The process has been accelerated.
tutorial_intro_hybridizator_1;OK, it's time we moved a little faster! \We're going to hybridize our 2 creatures.
tutorial_open_hybridizator_08;Eva maintains a romantic belief that these genetic masterpieces actually evolve outside of their genetic predetermined destinies. I'm a science guy. And I know that a good Psy-Captain can inspire them to fight above and beyond.
tutorial_open_hybridizator_09;Select the Breeding Center over there... Don't worry about the science behind it. I've got that covered. All you have to do is select two Mutants and cross-breed.
tutorial_open_hybridizator_1;Start by clicking on this fantastic Breeding Center.
tutorial_open_hybridizator_2;Thanks Darwin. We need to speed things up. Now, Psy-Captain. Click on Cross-Breeding.
tutorial_intro_mutosterone_1;Your mutants need mutosterone to hybridize.\nUsually, it is generated through battles, but we have no time for that now.\nWe're going to inject them directly. Click on [icon] to get some.
tutorial_select_hybridizator_1;You can’t breed mutants without a full bar of mutosterone. We’ve given you a head start here. In the future you’ll have to earn it through combat or get it by other means. Click on the two Mutants.
tutorial_select_hybridizator_2;Now, make room for science! Click on Cross-Breeding!
tutorial_rush_hybridizator_08;Cross-Breeding can take some time. Let us stand here and contemplate the miracle of science and our godlike powers to create life.
tutorial_rush_hybridizator_09;Excuse me Darwin, but we don't have a lot of time for philosophy. I've been lining up some combats and we need a team.
tutorial_rush_hybridizator_1;Open the Breeding Center, again.
tutorial_rush_hybridizator_2;Now click on "Accelerate".
tutorial_collect_hybridizator_2;Now we place the larva gently into the incubator.
tutorial_collect_hybridizator_1;It brings a tear to my eye every time. Behold… a genetic giant in larva form. A little time in the incubator and then your new Mutant will be ready for the arena.
tutorial_collect_hybridizator_11;Click on the Breeding Center.
tutorial_lottery;Each mutant inherits a gene from each parent but note that different Mutants may have exactly the same DNA; moreover, the order of the genes has an importance. Different combinations will create different species.
tutorial_rush_incubator_0;The new larva is being incubated. We're going to accelerate it again.
tutorial_rush_incubator_08;The Incubation was developed by the Spontaneous Spartan consortium, and is one of the greatest breakthroughs of the 22nd Century...
tutorial_rush_incubator_09;We'll continue the history lesson later, Darwin... We are in a hurry. Let's accelerate the incubation process with some Gold from our Sponsors.
tutorial_rush_incubator_1;Open the Incubator.
tutorial_rush_incubator_2;Now to speed things up.
tutorial_select_habitat_3;Choose one of the 2 compatible habitats to host your (SPECIMEN).
tutorial_intro_arena_1;It's finally time to build an arena!\nOpen the Shop
tutorial_buy_arena_1;Let's buy our first Arena.
tutorial_open_PVE_1;You can launch our first battle!\nClick on the Arena.
tutorial_open_PVE_2;The moment you've been waiting for has finally come. It's time for your first fight!
tutorial_open_pvemap_1;Get your team to Detroit! The Motor Rock Stadium is the perfect place to forge a reputation!
tutorial_select_team_1;Select three Mutants. The more you have, the more strategic your choices become, as some genes are more effective than others against your opponents.
tutorial_select_team_2;In a fight you can choose a friend to help you make a Tag Team Attack. For this fight, I'll be that friend!
tutorial_select_team_3_old;Validate your team!
tutorial_confirm_team_1;Perfect! Now your team is full, we can start.
tutorial_open_stage_1;For this first fight you’ll be up against some sparring Mutants before moving on to the real competition. And it will give me the chance to give you some tips on fighting in the Arena.
tutorial_open_stage_2;Campaign fights require Campaign Passes to challenge. You have 50 to start with and you replenish them slowly over time. They are fully replenished when you Level Up.
tutorial_intro_fight_1;The battle is turn-based.\nEach creature's speed determines the order of play.
tutorial_select_attack_1;Your Mutant is up first.\nChoose its first attack.
tutorial_select_attack_1bis;Each attack is linked to a gene. Certain genes are more powerful against others. This schematic shows you how the three basic genes work.\n\n[hud/schematic_fight01#300x167]
tutorial_select_target_1;Perfect, now select your first target.
tutorial_friendhelp_1;Tag Team Attacks can be made once per fight... and each friend can Tag up with you once per day. The more friends you have, the easier and more spectacular your battles become in the arena.
tutorial_mission_launch;Keep going! It’s a long way to the top. I’m going to rustle up some new sponsors. I left a to-do list, I’ll check-in on a regular basis to keep an eye on your progress.
tutorial_main_end_1;Impressive!\nI'll leave you to your battle, I have some work waiting for me…\nGood luck, (USER)!
tutorial_select_assist_1;Let's do a Tag Team Attack. First you need to choose an attack.
tutorial_first_victory_1;Congratulations! Your Mutants have levelled up, and produced mutosterone for future cross-breedings. But let's be honest, it was mostly thanks to my Mutant. The next time won't be so easy. By the way, when your Mutants level up they regain all their health, so you can get right back in the fight.
tutorial_back_to_fight_1;When your Mutants level up they regain all their health, so you can get right back in the fight. Ready to go again? Well alright, let's go!
tutorial_fullscreen;The place is getting crowded. To get a better view, let's go full screen!
tutorial_newcreature;Not so fast, Eva. Our protégé still has some vital steps to learn. Press OK and we shall show the creature to its new Compound.
tutorial_rename11;Can we at least give the Mutant a name already. Your computer-generated names are rather bland.
tutorial_rename12;Did Pasteur give names to each rabie cell he spotted under his microscope? Did Mendelev name every pea in his pods?...
tutorial_rename13;Darwin, our fans and sponsors need names they can cheer for!!
tutorial_rename14;A little fear is good for the fans, but a great name is even better! This is the moment to choose a memorable name for your new Mutant. Click on the box and get typing!
tutorial_intro_01;There you are! I just got back from a meeting with some of my old Sponsors and there's good news. We've got enough money in the bank to get you started. It's time for you to help me prove that I was right in picking you.
tutorial_intro_02;This lab's open-sky, which means fans, media, sponsors and our competitors will be keeping an eye on us. And that's what we want! The more experienced, powerful and genetically diverse our Mutants the more popular you will become.
tutorial_valid;Validate the choice!
tutorial_select_team_3;It's time to fight!
tutorial_select_team_4;It's time to fight!
tutorial_select_assist_2;Now activate the Tag Team Attack.
tutorial_select_assist_3;Choose your target and let's annihilate them!
tutorialDescription_A;Robots have heavy armor and a weak attack but it damages all targets.
tutorialDescription_B;Contrary to cinematic lore, Zombies are fast and reliable.
tutorialDescription_C;The Warrior lands powerful blows but has limited health.
tutorial_select_specimen;Pick two Mutants out of the three here and validate your choice. You'll be able to get the third one later. I'm going to let Darwin explain the more complex splicing techiques.

caption_specimen_ad_11;400 years ago, a series of decorative egg-shaped boxes with special mechanisms to open them were created. Some 300 years later, advanced research made it possible to recreate small luxury robots based on the same principle: a strong and aerodynamic ovoid shape, and a rearrangement of parts to deploy a robotic device adapted to a particular task. This concept has not escaped the scientific teams at Genetic City, and these robots are now available in the arenas.

caption_mission_easter20_3;The other Psy Captains will be ruthless!
caption_mission_easter20_4;What do you say we take a break and heal your mutants?
caption_mission_easter20_5;Mystics often have gems on their equipment.
caption_mission_easter20_6;Keep going without stopping, we'll eventually find the egg.
caption_mission_easter20_7;Everything's at stake from now on. 
caption_mission_easter20_8;Catch your breath before the final stretch...
caption_mission_easter20_9;The last competitors to be eliminated before the location of the egg...
caption_mission_easter20_10;So that's the egg covered in diamonds? That was... unexpected.
DialogPVE_Event_easter20_1_1;Darwin? Getting ready to hunt for eggs? Aren't you a little old for that?
DialogPVE_Event_easter20_1_2;No I'm not! Besides, this year is kind of special!
DialogPVE_Event_easter20_1_3;According to some information I've received...
DialogPVE_Event_easter20_1_4;We could find an egg covered in diamonds! A good opportunity to get rich!
DialogPVE_Event_easter20_1_5;That's why you're here, Urban!
DialogPVE_Event_easter20_1_6;But who's to say our Psy Captain won't find the egg first?
DialogPVE_Event_easter20_1_7;He can always try to catch me up. I'm going ahead!
DialogPVE_Event_easter20_2_1;Well, Darwin? Anything yet?
DialogPVE_Event_easter20_2_2;Unfortunately... No. But I'm still looking. If I have a chance to improve the lab by selling the egg...
DialogPVE_Event_easter20_2_3;That's it! Hm, no, it's just a token with an egg drawn on it. I hope that's not what it is...
DialogPVE_Event_easter20_2_4;Might as well keep going, maybe we didn't look hard enough in the arena!
DialogPVE_Event_easter20_3_1;So in the end, there were no eggs, just these tokens?
DialogPVE_Event_easter20_3_2;Apparently. But we can trade them.
DialogPVE_Event_easter20_3_3;Urban took the opportunity to run some tests in his fusion machine. And he lost all his chips in the process.
DialogPVE_Event_easter20_3_4;Serves him right! Try not to make the same mistake, Psy Captain.

Following multiple experiments by advocates of his point of view, clones of the instigator of this movement were designed to allow him to live forever. But these clones were animated by destructive behavior, and mysteriously vanished into thin air... Until now, at least.

caption_specimen_ea_11;Designed to be the ultimate space combat drone, the Dreadnought has absolutely incredible features... at least on paper. Reinforced shielding with radiation and heat absorbers, multiple high-powered cannons, and rock-solid hyperspace speed. Its only issue? Radar and hyperspace bubble distortion problems, having relegated it from a space warfare weapon to a machine dedicated to the big show.

Specimen_CA_99;Awakened Missy
caption_specimen_ca_99_old;Following her vacation, Missy seems to have been replaced by a powerful and aggressive robotic entity. Perhaps we can learn more about what happened by investigating her...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_1_1_1;Soon we will be back on! You feeling up to it, Psy Captain?
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_1_1_2;Trevor's really nice to have us on his new show!
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_1_1_3;New set, new setting... It looks great! Ah, it's starting !
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_1_1_4;Good evening, everyone, and welcome to Genetic City! Hello Missy!
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_1_1_5;Hello, Trevor. What great news are you going to bring us tonight?
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_1_1_6;The program includes Mutant Fights, Promising Psy Captains and our GREEEEAT COMPETITIOOOON!
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_1_1_7;What ent-thusiasm! I thought we could change the subject for once...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_1_1_8;For example, let's talk about the wonderful Professor Mutenstein and what he c-can do for us.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_1_1_9;Wait! That wasn't in the script! Turn off the air!
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_1_1_10;Keep filming! Watch, viewers, how powerful the mutant's abilities are!
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_1_1_11;Quick, we must intervene before it gets out of hand! Darwin, deploy the mutants urgently!
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_1_2_1;B-b-but! W-w-w-what was that?
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_1_2_2;Hahaha! At last you discover the fights seen up close! So, what are your impressions?
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_1_2_3;Urban, no need to be ironic! You can see he's in shock!
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_1_2_4;You have to laugh a little once in a while! In any case, it's really not normal!
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_1_2_5;Missy's always been so calm and kind, what's gotten into her?
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_1_2_6;What worries me most is the way she talked about Mutenstein.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_1_2_7;It's true that this old fool has always been into dirty tricks...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_1_2_8;The only way to find out what happened is to go after her.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_1_2_9;It's not going to be easy, more mutants are coming! Get ready, Psy Captain!
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_1_3_1;So, those losers managed to survive...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_1_3_2;Come on, Missy, calm down! We can go back on the show and forget about it... right?
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_1_3_3;Do you really think I'm going to keep listening to a guy as full of himself as you are?
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_1_3_4;It's over! Missy is starring as the new star of Mutants TV. Or even more.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_1_3_5;What do you mean more than that, I'm the star anchorm...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_1_3_6;SILENCE, VERMIN!
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_1_3_7;Let's see if you can survive this... Then we'll talk again...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_1_4_1;There she goes... It's real easy to talk to her again under these conditions...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_1_4_2;Don't tell me she didn't mean everything she said? I'm still the star anchor, right?
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_1_4_3;Trevor, shut up. This is no time to talk about careers!
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_1_4_4;Maybe you're right... But what can we do?
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_1_4_5;During the fight, she dropped something... Let me see what it is.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_1_4_6;Looks like... a data storage system... Ah, it's encrypted! Hey kid, can you decode this?
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_1_4_7;I'll give it a try. Maybe we can find out more about what happened to her.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_1_1;So, Darwin, any luck with Missy's data?
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_1_2;Fortunately for us, Mutenstein has retained similar patterns in its encryptions.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_1_3;Can you be clearer?
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_1_4;I was able to decipher much of the data, but not all the files.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_1_5;The most interesting one seems to be a video file, the rest is mostly composed of holiday pictures.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_1_6;Can we see it? It'd be interesting to know what was said.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_1_7;Not sure we have time for Missy's vacation vlog! We've got company near the studios!
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_2_1;We have a moment's respite, let's watch this video!
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_2_2;Are you interested in holiday movies after all?
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_2_3;I haven't decrypted everything yet, but we've got a first extract.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_2_4;So, in exchange for a few small services to facilitate your establishment in the business...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_2_5;I'm providing you with physical upgrades, advanced weaponry,
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_2_6;And the assurance of a career in which I won't have to just stand there and look good alongside Reed anymore!
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_2_7;Exactly, I think we have a perfectly fair deal.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_2_8;I... wasn't expecting this.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_2_9;So she's been working for Mutenstein since her vacation?
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_2_10;I really need to keep decrypting the files, I'm missing some metadata from the file.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_2_11;We have no choice but to get our hands on her and make her explain herself.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_2_12;Let's go over the studios with a fine-tooth comb, Psy Captain!
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_3_1;I was able to finish analyzing the file. And you're not gonna like it.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_3_2;Can you be more specific?
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_3_3;According to the metadata, Missy's been working with Mutenstein... for several years.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_3_4;WHAT? So she's always been part of his plans...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_3_5;And there was a hidden file. Another video, not as nice as the last one...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_3_6;I'll show you right now.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_3_7;Experimental Journal - Patient number 278 - 14/07/2320
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_3_8;The patient is a young female TV presenter.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_3_9;It is planned to improve her body with cybernetic implants and artificial muscle fibres.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_3_10;Let's add a complementary modification: these DNA fragments of alien origin.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_3_11;Logically, this should provide her with resistance to alien mind control.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_3_12;Otherwise... she'll be permanently controlled by an alien! Gnihihihihi! What an idiot!
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_3_13;So Missy's vacation wasn't really a vacation...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_3_14;We've got to find her fast and try to do something for her before things get out of hand...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_4_1;Ah, you finally beat that... "improved" version of my assistant.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_4_2;Yes, and you've been absolutely appallingly cowardly and unhelpful.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_4_3;I'm not the one who decided to change the text live!
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_4_4;Stop it with your "live". Everybody knows it's on tape.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_4_5;Darwin, Urban, you think you can cure her?
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_4_6;Yeah, but it's gonna take some time, and it's not gonna be without risk. But we can stabilize her.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_4_7;And then I plan to ask her some questions about Mutenstein.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_4_8;I still have to take revenge on him. Maybe she can help us.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_4_9;You seem pretty optimistic about that.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary20_2_4_10;When she finds out what he did to her, it'll certainly make her react.

Even worse, the cleaning and sprinkling elements were also contaminated with toxic sludge. As a result, the only place for these robots is in the arena.

caption_specimen_ee_11;Space... a place devoid of life... but what if a few orbiting elements were to develop a consciousness, acting as a hive mind within a non-living organism, made of space rocks and ice blocks? What if such an entity fell on Earth, though almost getting annihilated while plummeting through the atmosphere? Would it be considered as a simple pile of rocks? As a conscious being? For the latter reason, it chose to set its parts to mimic a human face despite being in the arena - to try communicating with Earthlings.

caption_specimen_bc_11;The very embodiment of destructive fury, Ragefang is a degenerate, bloodthirsty entity in perpetual need of violence. This creature was created by mixing all strains of the rabies virus, then injecting it into various living creatures, to keep only the most aggressive of them. Ragefang won't hesitate to pounce on its enemies, scratching and biting them, without even waiting for you to ask, succumbing to its rage impulses. Be careful that it doesn't attack you!

caption_specimen_ca_99;After her last vacation, Missy was "activated" by Mutenstein, who took the opportunity to grant her new talents and equipment. He probably intends to use this new form of Missy as a tool to control public opinion and to spread his eugenicist theses on the world... Fortunately, Missy was able to regain a more human appearance and limit her destructive abilities to acceptable values. This mutant has cyber and galactic attacks. 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween20_1_1;What's the matter with you, Darwin? You look worried.
DialogPVE_Event_halloween20_1_2;I hate this time of year!
DialogPVE_Event_halloween20_1_3;Because you're easily scared, haha!
DialogPVE_Event_halloween20_1_4;It's mostly because there's something sinister in the air.
DialogPVE_Event_halloween20_1_5;To be safe, you can still curl up in a corner!
DialogPVE_Event_halloween20_1_6;Very witty! But he's not wrong, maybe you should be a bit braver!
DialogPVE_Event_halloween20_1_7;And what's this greenish mist? *coughs*
DialogPVE_Event_halloween20_1_8;What greeny mis... I don't feel so good.
DialogPVE_Event_halloween20_1_9;What's this? Some toxic stuff? Let's go higher to be safe!
DialogPVE_Event_halloween20_1_10;Psy Captain, as it seems you're not affected by it, go see where it comes from.
DialogPVE_Event_halloween20_2_1;Where... Where am I?
DialogPVE_Event_halloween20_2_2;On the roof, the mist has affected you quite a bit.
DialogPVE_Event_halloween20_2_3;And the Psy Captain covered our retreat.
DialogPVE_Event_halloween20_2_4;It seems that those with abilities are less impacted.
DialogPVE_Event_halloween20_2_5;And as you can't control mutants anymore...
DialogPVE_Event_halloween20_2_6;Thanks for the reminder!
DialogPVE_Event_halloween20_2_7;Sorry...
DialogPVE_Event_halloween20_2_8;Yeah, the same.
DialogPVE_Event_halloween20_2_9;What worries me is that we still don't know where it's coming from.
DialogPVE_Event_halloween20_2_10;You're going to have to venture into the mist, Psy Captain.
DialogPVE_Event_halloween20_3_1;Ah, Psy Captain, you're finally back.
DialogPVE_Event_halloween20_3_2;I guess you were able to get a few mutants out of the mist.
DialogPVE_Event_halloween20_3_3;While you were doing that, Darwin was able to find something.
DialogPVE_Event_halloween20_3_4;Or rather, someone.
DialogPVE_Event_halloween20_3_5;By using the access to the detection satellites...
DialogPVE_Event_halloween20_3_6;I was able to find the origin of the mist. A humanoid.
DialogPVE_Event_halloween20_3_7;He seems to be wearing some sort of mask, and has a lantern
DialogPVE_Event_halloween20_3_8;You'd better go and find him as soon as possible.
DialogPVE_Event_halloween20_4_1;Some fresh air, at last!
DialogPVE_Event_halloween20_4_2;Now that you've defeated him, let's take a small break.
DialogPVE_Event_halloween20_4_3;No rest for the wicked!
DialogPVE_Event_halloween20_4_4;Psy Captain, back to training!
DialogPVE_Event_halloween20_4_5;What's got into you? When did you get so motivated?
DialogPVE_Event_halloween20_4_6;If no one is training him, he'll never get better on his own! Now, let's go!

caption_specimen_d_12;This creature, close to many theropods, seems to have been especially effective in hunting during the Triassic period. Indeed, its powerful howling could terrorize its predators and deafen its preys, making them unable to locate it as it pounced on them. Incidentally, the staff of Mutants TV have partnered with Silence Corp in order to supply the audience with noise-cancelling headphones in the stadiums.

DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_1_1_1;Ah! Finally, Christmas holidays are here!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_1_1_2;Finally a little rest after this trying year
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_1_1_3;Rest? Might as well hit the pistes!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_1_1_4;Not everyone has your boundless energy, Urban!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_1_1_5;Well, I'm on my way, have fun!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_1_1_6;Finally! I thought he'd never leave!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_1_1_7;It is true that the two of you have quite a history together...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_1_1_8;No choice, I have to deal with it. But for once he's...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_1_1_9;Change of plan, I think staying here for Christmas is good too!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_1_1_10;What's going on?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_1_1_11;Toys! Everywhere! Alive! There's no way to take it easy!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_1_2_1;Why are there so many toys in this state?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_1_2_2;And above all, how did they become like that?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_1_2_3;Mutenstein?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_1_2_4;Mutenstein.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_1_2_5;Definitely Mutenstein!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_1_2_6;That doesn't explain why he did it!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_1_2_7;I'm not sure the question "why" makes sense with him....
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_1_2_8;Let's head to the arenas of the pit then.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_1_3_1;Of course... He is not here. Probably in one of his multiple laboratories...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_1_3_2;Or is it like last year and he has nothing to do with it?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_1_3_3;Do you seriously mean what you say?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_1_3_4;And why not?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_1_3_5;Because he is a mad scientist ready to do anything to experiment?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_1_3_6;Fair enough. But where do these toys come from?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_1_3_7;We have no choice but to look for another lead.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_2_1_1;Any news about our wonderful toys?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_2_1_2;Not really on my side.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_2_1_3;The only info I have is that the area where they are present is limited.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_2_1_4;Limited? What do you mean, limited?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_2_1_5;Roughly speaking, no further than Genetic City.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_2_1_6;So the problem is internal to the city.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_2_1_7;Wait, what's that flying thing? Let's have a look!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_2_2_1;That's what I was telling you, there's some kind of flying robot!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_2_2_2;I'm having trouble understanding...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_2_2_3;Looks like he's attacking some, and trying to control others?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_2_2_4;As a result... Is he an ally or an enemy?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_2_2_5;The only way to find out is to get closer to it.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_2_2_6;And we won't be able to do it without clearing the way!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_2_3_1;ANALYSIS IN PROGRESS...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_2_3_2;At least he doesn't attack us on sight, that's something.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_2_3_3;RECOGNITION COMPLETE. ADULT HUMANS DETECTED.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_2_3_4;Of course we're adults, can't you tell?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_2_3_5;Is that why you behave like a child?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_2_3_6;ARE YOU ALLIED AGAINST THESE CRAZY TOYS?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_2_3_7;Yes, more or less, we're trying to find out what's going on.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_2_3_8;DO YOU HAVE THE STRENGTH TO FACE THEM?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_2_3_9;What do you think, bucket of bolts? How else could we get here?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_2_3_10;SHOW OF POWER REQUIRED.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_2_4_1;POWER CONFIRMED.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_2_4_2;Of course! And so, who or what are you in all this?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_2_4_3;DREAM DEFENDER.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_2_4_4;DEFENDER OF CHILDREN'S HOPES AND DREAMS.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_2_4_5;HELP ME PROTECT GENETIC CITY
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_2_4_6;I WILL HELP YOU IN RETURN
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_2_4_7;It's not a bad deal...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_3_1_1;Eva? We have a little problem.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_3_1_2;Our new robotic friend attacked a little fast...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_3_1_3;And? He didn't destroy half the city, did he?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_3_1_4;No, but he attacked Missy, probably because of her genetic changes.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_3_1_5;I saw him shoot Missy in full flight, and she fell from several floors...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_3_1_6;No time to lose then!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_3_2_1;Trevor? What are you doing here? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_3_2_2;Darwin warned me about Missy... So I came.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_3_2_3;You want to be useful? Don't touch anything.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_3_2_4;I still went to check her files to find out what she was doing.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_3_2_5;And on top of that you spy on her?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_3_2_6;It was mostly to try to find something to help you.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_3_2_7;And I found this video message.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_3_2_8;Surrender and I may spare the city. If not, I'll release my worst creations!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_3_2_9;So it really is Mutenstein who's behind all this.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_3_2_10;Darwin, Trevor, stay with Missy. Psy-Captain, let's go!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_3_3_1;ERROR. DETECTION OF GALACTIC THREATS.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_3_3_2;Yes, we know that, it is Mutenstein who is at the origin of the problem.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_3_3_3;UNKNOWN WORD IN THE DATABASE.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_3_3_4;PLEASE REPHRASE.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_3_3_5;Mu-ten-stein! The mad scientist!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_3_3_6;SEARCH IN IDENTITY DATA
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_3_3_7;PROFESSOR ELDRITCH VON MUTENSTEIN. IS IT HIM?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_3_3_8;I guess... Of course we don't have Darwin or Urban when they could be useful!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_3_3_9;PROCEED WITH THE ARREST.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_3_3_10;I'LL DEAL WITH THE GALACTIC THREATS.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_3_4_1;He was able to run away again. He's so annoying!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_3_4_2;Urban? Where have you been all this time?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_3_4_3;On a lead. Don't forget that he left no evidence of his interventions.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_3_4_4;And no one will question his word given the extent of his influence.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_3_4_5;Besides us, you mean?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_3_4_6;Precisely. And we'll have to keep playing the game as long as he doesn't leave any traces.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_3_4_7;But Darwin will no doubt have time to analyze these papers that I was able to find.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas20_3_4_8;It could tell us exactly where to find him and his degenerate creations.

Rumor has it that it is still actively being hunted, so that it can finally participate in the World Tournament!

caption_specimen_cf_12;After recovering DNA fragments of the legendary samurai Miyamoto Musashi from ancient manuscripts of the Niten Ichi Ryu school, an extra-governmental organization attempted to reconstruct this ultimate warrior. Fortunately for world peace, his philosophy of existence was also written in his DNA, and he preferred to flee rather than serve. He now peacefully reigns over the dimension designed for him by an assistant of this extra-governmental team, but will not hesitate to defend himself with all his power if he is threatened.

caption_specimen_cb_12;Although ancient, the crossbow is a highly effective weapon for anyone who knows how to use it, and easier to tame than a bow. By combining fragments of DNA found on crossbows from all places and times, a malicious scientific team from Genetic City thought they could recreate an army of snipers. However, they had not contemplated that they would only be able to handle massive crossbows, nor that mass cloning techniques would lead to rapid cellular degeneration, leaving a troop of zombie crossbowmen in their wake. The project was interrupted by the authorities, and the cloning plans were recovered by a certain scientist...

Few have succeeded, and even fewer have been able to return.

caption_mission_easter21_4;No choice, let's get ready to fight. 
caption_mission_easter21_5;His army is massive, but not that powerful. 
caption_mission_easter21_6;The tyrant will be deposed! 
caption_mission_easter21_7;The chocolate world is truly a dangerous place! 
caption_mission_easter21_8;Is it Mutenstein, or something else? 
caption_mission_easter21_9;Oh no, not that monstrous chocolate rabbit again!

caption_mission_easter21_11;Everybody wants his position!
caption_mission_easter21_12;Time to put an end to the traitor's rule!
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_1_1;So Darwin? Ready to go egg hunting? 
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_1_2;Not really, I was on to something much more important.
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_1_3;Would you like to tell me about it?
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_1_4;Remember the mechanical eggs from last year? 
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_1_5;Those horrible spiders with their laser?
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_1_6;Exactly! They contained some strange coordinates. And a call for help. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_1_7;I talked to Urban about it, and he brought me a device to read these coordinates. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_1_8;And it corresponded to the coordinates for the devices used by Mutenstein! 
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_1_9;I managed to get my hands on one of these devices, and voilà! 
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_1_10;Did you steal it? Nice...
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_1_11;In any case, it will allow us to find out where this distress signal comes from. Let's go!
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_1_12;Erm... There's chocolate everywhere! It looks like... a chocolate world!
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_2_1;I've triangulated the signal, we should have it in sight... now.
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_2_2;I see what looks like a soldier or a general.
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_2_3;Hello, strangers! I assume you are here because I asked for your assistance?
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_2_4;Did you send those mechanical spiders?
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_2_5;Indeed. I'm looking for people to deal with a tortuous problem.
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_2_6;You see, this country was recently invaded by the forces of the Chocolate Chip Ogre.
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_2_7;The problem is that it eats everything, causing the population to starve, which puts our country at risk.
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_2_8;Can I count on your assistance?
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_3_1;Thank you very much. Now that the Chocolate Chip Ogre has been overthrown,
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_3_2;it will be much easier to turn this country around and restore it to its former greatness.
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_3_3;And who is your leader?
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_3_4;He is probably still in prison since his capture by the Ogre.
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_3_5;I will make sure that he quickly takes up the reins of the country.
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_3_6;In the meantime, could you do another task for me?
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_3_7;What now? More invaders?
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_3_8;Just one more time. A kind of distortion of reality, which seems to attract various creatures.
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_3_9;Unfortunately, it is in a somewhat remote part of the country.
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_3_10;Do you think Mutenstein might try to invade this country?
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_3_11;Would you be surprised? We might as well get on with it.
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_4_1;One good thing is that there is no one left in front of the distortion.
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_4_2;I will take this opportunity to finish the quick analysis.
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_4_3;Check the energy signatures, find out if Mutenstein is behind it.
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_4_4;Try not to take too long, we still have to meet their king.
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_4_5;And... It's OK, no traces or evidence of Mutenstein's presence in the area.
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_4_6;And the troop of soldiers holding us at gunpoint, is that normal too?
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_4_7;Surrender and face the punishment the Generalissimo has in store for you.
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_4_8;For attempted intrusion and destabilization of the kingdom, you are sentenced to death!
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_4_9;It's time to defend yourself! Psy Captain, Urban, it's your turn!
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_5_1;Stop it! Stop it! I'm overturning your convictions!
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_5_2;What, that's it?
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_5_3;You don't expect me to apologise to you!
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_5_4;It would be the least we could do, after asking for our help.
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_5_5;And after your treason in order to take control of the country!
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_5_6;What a nice mindest you have!
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_5_7;All right, then. Please accept my "apologies". 
DialogPVE_Event_easter21_5_8;Two leaders overthrown in such a short time... It's unstable in the land of chocolate!

Over time, other statues created using the same process were discovered, associated with even more ancient rulers. Through carbon dating and further geological analysis, fragments of banners were recovered from the vicinity of these statues, and DNA analysis identified a sort of fusion between the characteristics of a general of that era and the traits of the clay that imprinted the genetic code. Years of work have made it possible to reconstruct living statues of sorts, under the authority of this general.

Able to survive for years in an anaerobic environment, its existence as a living creature was questioned by the international scientific community after the first observations. A more detailed study of its genetic code has revealed a capacity to regenerate necrotic cells similar to those of zombie mutants.

caption_specimen_ec_12;Coming from an extraterrestrial species living on an arid and rocky planet, this form of life seems to be composed entirely of rocks and minerals. However, it manages to prosper through trade, as their planet is also rich in mineral resources. Specifically, this planet is one of the only ones to have an abundance of stellarium, an extremely solid but light mineral capable of multiplying kinetic energy. It is, moreover, in this material that its weapon is built, a sort of enormous morning star, which is clearly not a mining tool.

DialogPVE_Anniversary21_1_1_4;It was a long trip, but a necessary one.
DialogPVE_Anniversary21_1_1_5;Yes, we have to put an end to this threat.
DialogPVE_Anniversary21_1_1_6;And it's not gonna be easy! Look!
DialogPVE_Anniversary21_1_1_7;He's got a whole army patrolling near the Pyramid.
DialogPVE_Anniversary21_1_1_8;We're going to have to clean up a bit!

Initially lulled by the poetic and magical songs on his own journey, he has carried on the tradition, ensuring that the musical mysticism lives on in the fjords of the far north. Beware if you challenge him to a singing duel, for he will not do you any favors, and may well hurt you if your voice is not up to par.

caption_specimen_ab_12;Formerly an experimental prototype of a fighting robot developed for the Xtreme Robot Fighting Championship, this model fell into disuse because of the high cost of repair it entailed. This robot was indeed equipped with detachable fists and thrusters, as well as a self-destruction system. It was scrapped fairly quickly with the end of this type of robot competition, then rehabilitated decades later in mutant battles, however its systems have degraded and its overall stability has greatly decreased.

DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_1_1;Do you feel this? There's something creepy in the air...
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_1_2;What do you mean? 
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_1_3;The city's officials haven't announced such grim lights for Halloween...
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_1_4;It might just be some kind of happening!
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_1_5;I'm not so sure. The weird artifact we found in Mutenstein's lab started to react.
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_1_6;The only signal points towards some old mining shaft. 
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_1_7;Let's go ! At the very least, it'll be close to a trial of courage! 
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_1_8;There we are. An old mine, left as is for 250 years! 
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_1_9;Try not to fall in the water, it's probably highly polluted. 
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_2_1;What was that weird creature? 
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_2_2;Most probably a cerberus. A litteral cerberus. 
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_2_3;You mean... The dog that's keeping the gates of hell? 
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_2_4;Exactly. But why would we have it in an old abandoned mine? 
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_2_5;I don't know. But it explains why this river's so dark...
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_2_6;Don't touch it, whatever the reason. You'd be stuck. 
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_2_7;There may be some current, but we all know how to swim! 
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_2_8;But this may be the mythical Styx, a cursed rived used to send souls to the afterlife.
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_2_9;Do your scans continue to point this way? 
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_2_10;Absolutely. We have no other choice besides going further. 
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_3_1;Acheron ? What are you doing here ? 
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_3_2;This is the realm I live in. The realm ruled by my boss. 
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_3_3;I'm already sorry about it, but I have to attack you. En garde!
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_4_1;Was that really necessary? 
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_4_2;Sadly for you (and for me), yes it was. I have obligations towards this river's ruler. 
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_4_3;Ruler...? Do you mean... Charon, the Boatman? 
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_4_4;Indeed. I have to prevent the living from going too far along the Styx. 
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_4_5;It happened a little too many times in the past, which angered Charon.
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_4_6;But you might be of some help... Could you do something for me ? 
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_4_7;You won't get our souls! 
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_4_8;Unrelated. Do you mind accompagnying me along the river? 
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_5_1;Did we really have to face this avatar of the Styx ? 
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_5_2;We probably could have avoided it. But I love watching humans fight. 
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_5_3;So, what's your problem with the Boatman?
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_5_4;Let's just say he withdrew in silence...
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_5_5;And has been since he managed to acquire some strange-shaped item.
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_5_6;Something like that? That thing we found at Mutenstein's? 
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_5_7;It seems so. Though, I don't know what it is, and he lets noone close. 
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_5_8;We just have to shake him up? I'm in! 
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_6_1;Charon has me give you his sincere apologies for his past behaviour. 
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_6_2;He's also having me give you that weird item you seem to have some knowledge of. 
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_6_3;Two similar weird artifacts... 
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_6_4;What do you think they're supposed to be ? 
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_6_5;Given the fact there are more than one, and in different places...
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_6_6;Spit it out! I'm dying to go back to the surface!
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_6_7;I'd also like to leave that misty cavern!
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_6_8;Either we have a device linked to Mutenstein's mind controlling system...
DialogPVE_Event_Halloween21_1_6_9;Or it's some means of communication. But who is supposed to answer it?

DialogPVE_Xmas21_1_1_2;New negative temperature records are expected.
DialogPVE_Xmas21_1_1_3;Again ? It’s been like this for days!
DialogPVE_Xmas21_1_1_4;And it seems it’s going to last a bit...
DialogPVE_Xmas21_1_1_5;And you cannot go outside without wearing 12 layers of clothes!
DialogPVE_Xmas21_1_1_6;I hate winter! Especially this year!
DialogPVE_Xmas21_1_1_7;We may still need to go outside...
DialogPVE_Xmas21_1_1_8;Are you kidding, Darwin ?
DialogPVE_Xmas21_1_1_9;Absolutely not. Given the temperature, we’re going to face electrical issues!
DialogPVE_Xmas21_1_1_10;No time to lose then. Psy-Captain, grab your thickest sweater!
DialogPVE_Xmas21_1_2_1;That’s what I was expecting about electrical issues.

DialogPVE_Xmas21_1_2_3;Thus implying multiple free-roaming mutants...

DialogPVE_Xmas21_1_3_2;Not too chilly, « Baron » ?
DialogPVE_Xmas21_1_3_3;You wouldn’t say that if your body wasn’t altered.
DialogPVE_Xmas21_1_3_4;At least, I don’t lose my efficiency.
DialogPVE_Xmas21_1_3_5;Instead of prancing around, can you be somewhat useful ?
DialogPVE_Xmas21_1_3_6;He’s trying to say: « We could use some help »
DialogPVE_Xmas21_1_3_7;Hm. I’ll see what I can do.
DialogPVE_Xmas21_1_3_8;Try to keep the civilians safe for now.
DialogPVE_Xmas21_1_4_1;Have you seen that creature in the streets ?
DialogPVE_Xmas21_1_4_2;I tried to chase it, but it emitted an intense cold energy...
DialogPVE_Xmas21_1_4_3;Despite my alterations, I had no choice but to retreat.
DialogPVE_Xmas21_1_4_4;Not so invincible for a newscaster!
DialogPVE_Xmas21_1_4_5;Can you guys stop bickering ?
DialogPVE_Xmas21_1_4_6;There’s some dangerous creature to find and fight!
DialogPVE_Xmas21_1_4_7;Well then, let’s go!
DialogPVE_Xmas21_1_5_1;It seems the creature fled off somewhere.
DialogPVE_Xmas21_1_5_2;Nice! We might have a chance to stop freezing!
DialogPVE_Xmas21_1_5_3;Nothing planned about that, according to weather data.
DialogPVE_Xmas21_1_5_4;You tell me we’ve just done all that for nothing?
DialogPVE_Xmas21_1_5_5;No. But there’s probably something stronger and colder we didn’t find.
DialogPVE_Xmas21_1_5_6;Switch your satellites on, and tell us as soon as you find anything!
DialogPVE_Xmas21_2_1_1;Eva! Eva! I’ve got it! I found it!
DialogPVE_Xmas21_2_1_2;Can you stop shouting? I was trying to sleep!
DialogPVE_Xmas21_2_1_3;He’s not wrong. What exactly did you find?
DialogPVE_Xmas21_2_1_4;Thermal flow disturbances!
DialogPVE_Xmas21_2_1_5;I’ve been looking for them for days!
DialogPVE_Xmas21_2_1_6;So... Do you know what we’re going to look for?
DialogPVE_Xmas21_2_1_7;Not exactly. But I do know where to search!
DialogPVE_Xmas21_2_1_8;Time to go, Psy-Captain!
DialogPVE_Xmas21_2_2_1;Except for battling mutants, we didn’t find a single thing here.
DialogPVE_Xmas21_2_2_2;It’s illogical! I have found disturbances in thermal flows, I swear!
DialogPVE_Xmas21_2_2_3;You have screwed up! We could have stayed somewhere warm!
DialogPVE_Xmas21_2_2_4;Now that we’re around here, we keep searching!
DialogPVE_Xmas21_2_2_5;Had I known we would’ve stayed so long, I would have engineered something!
DialogPVE_Xmas21_2_2_6;Too late for regrets!
DialogPVE_Xmas21_2_3_1;Eventually, that wasn’t a screw-up.
DialogPVE_Xmas21_2_3_2;Did you see that mutant? And these strange markings?
DialogPVE_Xmas21_2_3_3;Yes, they match those we have seen recently.
DialogPVE_Xmas21_2_3_4;It’s a good thing. I’d love to have a warmer winter.
DialogPVE_Xmas21_2_3_5;Psy-Captain, lead the group!
DialogPVE_Xmas21_2_4_1;Another mutant with these markings...
DialogPVE_Xmas21_2_4_2;Wait! It reminds me of some weird things we saw in the lab, last summer.
DialogPVE_Xmas21_2_4_3;Mutenstein’s lab?
DialogPVE_Xmas21_2_4_4;Obviously! I wasn’t talking about mine!
DialogPVE_Xmas21_2_4_5;There were some comparable markings on a screen.
DialogPVE_Xmas21_2_4_6;You think he’s responsible for this?
DialogPVE_Xmas21_2_4_7;Either it’s him, or someone he’s in touch with.
DialogPVE_Xmas21_2_4_8;Either way, no time to lose.
DialogPVE_Xmas21_2_5_1;WHAT is that thing?
DialogPVE_Xmas21_2_5_3;It looks like some kind of frozen...alien... angel... creature?
DialogPVE_Xmas21_2_5_4;Darwin? Any ideas?
DialogPVE_Xmas21_2_5_5;Certainly some unlisted mutant!
DialogPVE_Xmas21_2_5_6;And without a doubt, an extremely dangerous one!

Its symbolic body markings, and lack of a face clearly imply an extraterrestrial origin. It's even possible for this creature to have an extradimensional origin. It appeared during a cold wave, and seems to have a strong cold affinity, being able to absorb heat, and establish some psychic domination over other creatures bearing similar markings.

Unfortunately for these poor souls, power always has a price, and this one is often a form of eternal servitude in the non-life, at the orders of these powers which seek to extend their harmful influence by the intermediary of figures recognized by the common people... Some researchers then sought to make this substance that animates corpses interact with mutosterone, which gave a second non-life to these profaned religious.

DialogPVE_Valentines22_1_2;What tournament? There’s no tournament at this time of the year!
DialogPVE_Valentines22_1_3;It seems the Mayor of Genetic City has organized a Valentines tournament.
DialogPVE_Valentines22_1_4;It’s named « Valentines Whirling Passion ».
DialogPVE_Valentines22_1_5;Wait... Wasn’t it the Mayor that made this old tournament stop?
DialogPVE_Valentines22_1_6;You’re confusing things. A former Mayor stopped it, long ago.
DialogPVE_Valentines22_1_7;It’s still quite unusual from the Mayor.
DialogPVE_Valentines22_1_8;Maybe did they want to reboot this old tournament?

DialogPVE_Valentines22_3_1;You were right. For once, there are a few novelties in the arena.
DialogPVE_Valentines22_3_2;However, I’d rather have fought them myself.
DialogPVE_Valentines22_3_3;I still wonder about something...
DialogPVE_Valentines22_3_4;What’s troubling you, Darwin?
DialogPVE_Valentines22_3_5;If they are the tournament organizer... Can anyone tell me where the Mayor is?
DialogPVE_Valentines22_3_6;Is that so important ?

caption_specimen_dc_12;This humanoid lagomorph is one of the most dangerous specimens of its species. Most of the time, it's staying underground digging tunnels and making structures collapse, but it's also prone to sneakily attack people using its pickaxe, jumping out of its own tunnels.

DialogPVE_Easter22_1_1;Eva, Psy-Captain, you're both finally here! 
DialogPVE_Easter22_1_2;What's going on, Darwin?
DialogPVE_Easter22_1_3;We just received some transmission... from the Chocoworld. 
DialogPVE_Easter22_1_4;What are they expecting from us exactly?
DialogPVE_Easter22_1_5;It seems like a standard invitation, with very few details.
DialogPVE_Easter22_1_6;Let's go and find out what's all this is about.
DialogPVE_Easter22_2_1;My dear guests, there you are! 
DialogPVE_Easter22_2_2;But... You just attacked us mere seconds ago!
DialogPVE_Easter22_2_3;A simple test, I wanted to be sure you would be able to help.
DialogPVE_Easter22_2_4;Is that supposed to be a joke? We almost died!
DialogPVE_Easter22_2_5;You didn't, everything's fine.
DialogPVE_Easter22_2_6;(I cannot bear him and his behaviour...)
DialogPVE_Easter22_2_7;I invited you to help me with a small problem...
DialogPVE_Easter22_2_8;A problem... involving rabbits.
DialogPVE_Easter22_3_1;As you have seen, many rabbits try to take this place. 
DialogPVE_Easter22_3_2;A hard-earned place, as you all know.
DialogPVE_Easter22_3_3;Earned... Overthrown would be a better word!
DialogPVE_Easter22_3_4;Whatever, these rabbit troops are causing us much trouble.
DialogPVE_Easter22_3_5;And I would have appreciated that you, Psy-Captain, went and took care of them. 
DialogPVE_Easter22_3_6;Do you think you can do it? It might not be easy.
DialogPVE_Easter22_3_7;I'm certain we all have something to draw out of it.
DialogPVE_Easter22_4_1;Très bien, now is the time for their leader, some evil digging bunny !
DialogPVE_Easter22_4_2;A...digging... bunny? Are you talking about a mutant, or just the animal?
DialogPVE_Easter22_4_3;A mutant, specialized in undermining. 
DialogPVE_Easter22_4_4;This one's the source of all recent earthquakes!
DialogPVE_Easter22_4_5;Get rid of it, and things will be back in order.
DialogPVE_Easter22_5_1;We just took it out. Still need us around? 
DialogPVE_Easter22_5_2;Not for the present time...
DialogPVE_Easter22_5_3;Good thing. I'm sick of seeing this much chocolate everywhere...
DialogPVE_Easter22_5_4;And I'd gladly return to my lab (and my bed!)
DialogPVE_Easter22_5_5;In the meantime, please keep that little bell...
DialogPVE_Easter22_5_6;Should you hear it ring, it would mean I need your services again...

DialogPVE_storypatch_1_1_1;You look worried today, Eva. What’s on your mind?
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_1_2;It’s about Mutenstein. He’ll come back. I know it. He always does.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_1_3;What do you think we should do?
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_1_4;Just stop waiting! Every time, we only react to his looming threats.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_1_5;We face him directly, and he always flees. It’s time we track him down by ourselves.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_1_6;It pains me to say so, but I agree. Darwin, what kind of intel do we have on Mutenstein?
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_1_7;Apart from the fact he’s a total madman.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_1_8;He’s someone... brilliant. His works have completely revolutionized genetic technology.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_1_9;His experiments have also injured a lot of people along the way...
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_1_10;Yes. But someone as rich as him is easily forgiven for his mistakes...
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_1_11;I’ve been looking for data about his wealth, but it seems to be beyond all expectations...
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_1_12;We’ll find out how to track him. Meanwhile, don’t drop your training, Psy Captain.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_2_1;Let’s sum up. Which plans did we thwart until then? We might be able to find his next move.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_2_2;Hmm... He managed to use both dark matter and antimatter to create destructive mutants.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_2_3;I remember. Also, that time he implanted an alien mind in Missy’s brain. At least that one was funny.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_2_4;No Urban it wasn't "funny". Especially since he implanted it by force.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_2_5;And Missy was physically altered in addition to her genetic modifications.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_2_6;Of which she’s quite proud of, now. She cannot stop boasting about her integrated laser.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_2_7;Please, focus. What can we draw out of all this?
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_2_8;He’s dangerous. But we already knew that.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_2_9;He could never do that alone. Even with that kind of wealth, he needs to have powerful contacts.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_2_10;Plus, he owns the Pit and all arenas in it. We probably underestimated his tentacular network.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_2_11;Vruuuuu! Vruuuuu...
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_2_12;We need to dig deeper, Psy Captain.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_3_1;The last time we faced Mutenstein, in the black pyramid, what was he working on?
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_3_2;We don't know exactly, and that’s what worries me the most.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_3_3;Anyway, Mutenstein put a lot of measures in place to hide at that time.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_3_4;It took me a long time to find the coordinates, even satellites weren’t able to locate it.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_3_5;He was afraid we would find him! The pyramid was guarded by many mutants.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_3_6;Mutenstein was probably onto some evil plan inside. Advanced weaponry...
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_3_7;Clones of us both... I hope we destroyed them all.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_3_8;I hope it as well. But I’m certain his most dangerous projects took place in his special laboratories.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_3_9;We made it into his cosmic research lab, then into the other laboratory...
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_3_10;Just before he escaped without leaving much behind.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_3_11;Vruuuuu! Vruuuuu!
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_3_12;Yes, except you little guy.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_4_1;Mutenstein keeps escaping, but he left another clue besides Ctopy.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_4_2;Do you mean, the weird artifacts? How many of these things did we collect?
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_4_3;Three. And these are not simply "things". They are something more. I just don’t know exactly what.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_4_4;You’ll find out, Darwin. Is this one the artifact left in the pyramid?
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_4_5;Yes, I’ve never seen something similar before. Could he leave them behind to mess with our minds?
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_4_6;Better stay cautious about his intentions. We have three artifacts, is that it?
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_4_7;Right. The second was gifted to us by Charon, on the last Halloween.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_4_8;And the third artifact was found this winter, when Genetic City was hit by heat flow anomalies.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_4_9;The mutants were all sporting all these strange marks, like that Angel...
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_4_10;Darwin, do you think the artifacts could be used together in some way?
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_4_11;I started looking into some connection system between them, but I’ll need some robotic components to go further.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_4_12;Time to work, Psy Captain! We’ll bring Darwin the components he needs, no time to lose.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_5_1;Any breakthrough with what we brought you, Darwin?
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_5_2;I think... Only the subatomic particle collider to plug...
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_5_3;You connected the wires wrongly. The red needs to connect to the superelectron sensor.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_5_4;No, it’s the blue wire. I’m certain of my wiring.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_5_5;As you wish...
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_5_6;Now I push the button... and...
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_5_7;... and nothing. Told you so, it was the red one. I switch the wires...
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_5_8;And now I press that button again...
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_5_9;... and once again, nothing. Thanks for the suspense, Urban.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_5_10;Always a pleasure Eva.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_5_11;I took a wrong direction. I’ll try a new assembly, but I’ll need more complex parts.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_5_12;Just say it, and we’ll craft what you need with the Psy Captain.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_6_1;I finished the new assembly between the artifacts! I press the button again and... Hmm. Still nothing.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_6_2;It’s alright, Darwin, it’s a matter of perseverance to understand these.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_6_3;Solving this problem will take me more time than I thought, but I think I can make it.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_6_4;More time? How much time, Darwin?
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_6_5;I cannot tell, I might find a solution in two hours, or maybe two weeks, two months, two years...
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_6_6;Don’t push yourself, do what you can.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_6_7;Don’t push yourself? If Mutenstein is moving in the dark, we don’t have time to spare.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_6_8;Your solutions, Urban? It’s not as if we had a choice.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_6_9;I know, but I’m fed up with this. Want some ultra-tech? Let’s find it where it is.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_6_10;Mutenstein never hesitates to use dirty methods, time for us to do the same.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_6_11;I'm not sure that from an ethical point of view...
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_6_12;Follow me, Psy-Captain! From now on, we’ll do things my way.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_7_1;How are things going, Urban? Need some help?
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_7_2;Yes, just retighten the bolts on the boson detector.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_7_3;It seems you’re onto something.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_7_4;My granny always said : life is always easier with you have a triphased thermodynamic reactor.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_7_5;There’s still an issue. We have a lot of advanced parts, but not the tools to assemble the artifacts.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_7_6;What if we used some high-temperature welding? Or with some galactic tools?
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_7_7;Missy might be able to help! She has her own integrated laser system since her last meeting with Mutenstein.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_7_8;Indeed, that might work on these kinds of alloys.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_7_9;And where is Missy today? Has anyone seen her?
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_7_10;No, but she’s probably not too far away.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_7_11;She’s probably once again trying to act as a superhero in Genetic City streets...
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_7_12;We’ll see. Follow me, Psy Captain, we’re looking for Missy !
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_8_1;And... that’s it! It was easy, with my super integrated beam! You just had to ask, Urban!
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_8_2;Grrr...
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_8_3;Please just stop, and look at the artifacts. They seem to react...
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_8_4;They just activated! We did it!
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_8_5;It’s cute, it’s blinking everywhere! Like a Christmas tree!
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_8_6;However, we still don’t know a thing about their utility.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_8_7;Not so sure. The polydimensional wave interceptor is reacting.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_8_8;It looks like some noise... Can you eliminate the noise to catch the signal?
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_8_9;No, we need some very powerful emitter to do that.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_8_10;Where could we find such an emitter?
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_8_11;We need to ask Reed if we could use the TV studio emitter, of course! It’s cutting-edge tech!
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_8_12;Good idea Missy, I should have thought about it! Let’s all go there, Psy-Captain!
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_9_1;Wait... You want to use the emitter to activate three unidentified alien artifacts together?
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_9_2;Exactly, Trevor. It’s urgent, we need to connect as soon as possible to the emitter.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_9_3;Hmm... No. I don’t think it’s possible, I’m sorry.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_9_4;What do you mean, "not possible"?
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_9_5;Calm down, Urban. Why can’t we use the studio emitter, Reed?
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_9_6;I’d like to help you, but sadly, I cannot let you do it.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_9_7;Reed, it’s important. You have to trust us. Please.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_9_8;Of course, I trust you, Eva, Darwin. I’d like to accept. But it’s still a no.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_9_9;REED... Until now I did have a very nice day beating up some baddies. Don’t push your luck...
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_9_10;All things considered... I may be able to give you some limited access to the emitter...
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_9_11;If you do something for me in return. It’s no big deal, but it would help me...
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_10_1;Are we connected to the emitter? Can you decipher the parasite noise from the artifacts, Darwin?
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_10_2;I’m just finishing the positronic translator configuration process...
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_10_3;Vruuuuuuu! Vruuuuuu!
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_10_4;VRUUUUUUUU!
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_10_5;Just a few seconds... That’s it! I push the button.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_10_6;Bzzzzt... KCHRCHRCHRKCHR....
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_10_7;Are you sure the decoded data are ok? I don’t understand a thing.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_10_8;Absolutely certain. All parameters are green, I checked four times.
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_10_9;Then what are we listening to?
DialogPVE_storypatch_1_10_10;I don’t know. I think it could be a message from another dimension.

However, this type of assembly is extremely unstable, and it becomes necessary to rebuild it on a regular basis. On the other side, this one's theoretically immortal.

DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_1_1;We currently have no further news about these black cube appearances...
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_1_2;That cube issue is still there... Doesn’t it feel weird to you, Darwin ?
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_1_3;It does. Especially as Urban didn’t give you much news lately.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_1_4;Do you think he’s up to something?
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_1_5;PSY-CAPTAIN! We need to talk. Now.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_1_6;Urban... Finally out of your lab?
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_1_7;No time for chitchat. It’s urgent we deal with those damned cubes.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_1_8;So, you admit you have something to do with them.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_1_9;No way! I’ve been looking for a solution for weeks!
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_1_10;And could you please explain what’s this all about?
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_1_11;As I said, there’s no time. We’ll talk later.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_1_12;Psy-Captain, take your stuff, we’ve got cubes to break down!
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_2_1;So, I need to tell you what happens.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_2_2;These strange, black cubes, appearing all over the world.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_2_3;They’ve started this behaviour about a month ago.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_2_4;At the beginning, I thought it was just a coincidence.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_2_5;But reading again my research on that subject, and the redhead’s compiled data...
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_2_6;I understood we closed our eyes about a specific problem.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_2_7;There was a factory we lost contact with, a few years ago, invaded by A027441.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_2_8;It seems that factory kept producing all those cubes. And as they are mutants...
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_2_9;It became a problem only people like you and me can solve.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_2_10;And then, we have to destroy all the cubes we encounter. And we need to do it fast.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_3_1;Both of you are OK? Nobody’s hurt?
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_3_2;No, everything was fine, before you called us.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_3_3;I pick up where I left off. Destroying these cubes lets us retrieve their internal memory.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_3_4;I’m not sure I understand, Urban. Isn’t their program absolutely identical?
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_3_5;Not at all. They seem to use a highly distributed data system.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_3_6;Digging deeper in the data, I found some strange code fragments.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_3_7;These fragments seem to be hidden data, and these data seem to be damaged by replications.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_3_8;You want us to use the lab’s main processors to reconstruct those damaged data?
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_3_9;Yep, but to that end, we need to get code fragments from a maximum number of cubes.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_3_10;Your equipment’s far better than mine. Thanks to you, Psy-Captain, and to your tournament victories.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_3_11;I hang up, we’ve got black boxes to retrieve.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_4_1;There we are, another one of these memory disks.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_4_2;Darwin, do you copy?
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_4_3;The transmission’s quite bad, but it’ll do.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_4_4;I’m sending you the content of all internal memories we could find.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_4_5;Did you find some info on your side?
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_4_6;Analyzing the data made me think the fragments are part of some schematics.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_4_7;What kind of schematics?
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_4_8;No idea. The data are far too fragmented. It seems linked to their AI, or their com network.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_4_9;Try to see if you can expand with the new d... *CRSHHHH*
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_4_10;Urban? Psy-Captain? Do you copy? *CRSHH... BZZT*
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_4_11;Urb*SHH* Psy-*CRKZT*ain !
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_4_12;Damned second-hand junk! The communicator’s dead.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_4_13;But I think we found the place all these cubes come from...
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_4_14;Psy-Captain... I think it’s time for you to show everything you can do.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_5_1;Phew.. I almost thought this last wave would end the both of us...
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_5_2;You seem to have been hurt quite a bit as well...
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_5_3;Deep down, it reassures me somehow, that you’re not as invincible as you look.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_5_4;I still have a chance to defeat you someday in an arena.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_5_5;After all, I have an image to uphold, between the arenas, the battles, popularity...
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_5_6;We need to contact the others very soon. They might believe we’re dead.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_5_7;And as damaged as we are... Not sure we could come back by ourselves.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_5_8;Let’s try this old message communicator. It should suffice.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_5_9;... And... done. Already an answer?
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_5_10;« We’re coming to get you! Darwin’s almost finished with the signal and data.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_5_11;It fits with a machine, I didn’t completely understand what its purpose was.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_1_5_12;There shouldn’t be too long to make the test runs. »

DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_1_1;Darwin! How is it going with that connection? I cannot lose more time here!
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_1_2;Please be patient, it’s almost finished... We’re at 99%.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_1_3;So, if I did understand, you’re using this device to...
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_1_4;To enter the cubes’ digital network, and see what’s in there.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_1_5;This device allows us to digitalize our consciousnesses.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_1_6;You’re... entering the machine?
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_1_7;That’s about it. And before you ask: yes, it’s dangerous.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_1_8;I’m taking the Psy-Captain with me, by the way. Two people are better than one.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_1_9;As Darwin connected the device to the lab’s internal network...
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_1_10;The Psy-Captain’s mutant data will be directly accessible, should we have to battle.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_1_11;It’s all good! 100%! You can activate the device, and we should be able to contact you!
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_1_12;Psy-Captain, let’s go! If we’re split up, first thing is to find each other!
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_2_1;There you are, Psy-Captain! I suppose you had to fight your way towards here?
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_2_2;I have to admit, I didn’t expect that.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_2_3;I thought it would be... smaller. And darker.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_2_4;Urban, Psy-Captain, do you copy?
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_2_5;We’ve been trying to contact you for a while without success.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_2_6;No problem, we’re both here, even though we were split up.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_2_7;Did you find the network’s core?
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_2_8;I suppose it’s that luminous sphere we can see over there.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_2_9;But it will take some time. And there are defenses...
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_2_10;We call you back when we have some news.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_3_1;Even more machines, data and cybernetic creatures...
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_3_2;I’m starting to believe that the cube-controlling AI only understands that.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_3_3;Though, it’s an AI. It might have been programmed only for that.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_3_4;There are so many other things, so many other mutants to discover...
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_3_5;Still, it’s strange...
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_3_6;Even though we progress towards the core, it seems it never gets closer...
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_3_7;A bit like stars in the sky...
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_3_8;--Analysis in progress... Creature data incompatible with the current domain.--
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_3_9;--Activating cleanup process.--
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_3_10;Things are heating up! Prepare to fight, Psy-Captain!
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_4_1;It was close, these robots were far tougher than the previous ones.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_4_2;Hopefully you were there to take care of the last ones.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_4_3;We should get in touch with Darwin and Eva, they’re probably starting to worry.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_4_4;Eva? Darwin? Do you copy?
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_4_5;Yes, Urban! Any news?
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_4_6;We just fought some cybernetic entity, a very aggressive mutant.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_4_7;It seemed to control part of the defenses. And we’re getting close to the core.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_4_8;There’s still one of these strange entities over there.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_4_9;Try to get closer, to see if it’s some kind of projection from the central AI.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_4_10;Damn! More defenses in front of us!
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_5_1;You, AI! You need to stop with these cubes!
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_5_2;You’re causing numerous problems on Earth’s surface!
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_5_3;But of course, you probably have some dedicated program and destruction is only collateral!
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_5_4;Hello, [digitalized humanoid entities].
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_5_5;I am this network’s central core.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_5_6;Since your intrusion, you have been trying to destroy the network.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_5_7;This action is contrary to the system’s preservation.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_5_8;Not at all! We have come here using YOUR plans, to prevent you from destroying our world!
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_5_9;The plans you hid in YOUR destructive cubes!
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_5_10;False interpretation, [digitalized humanoid entity]
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_5_11;Starting to analyze logical fallacy.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_5_12;You really think you can analyze us without us saying a word?
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_5_13;Psy-Captain, we’re going to destroy the glowing sphere. That should stop it.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_5_14;Analysis program transfered to a subroutine. Activating [system defense protocol]
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_6_1;There we are ! It’s been destroyed.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_6_2;Incorrect, [digitalized humanoid entity]. I am the system.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_6_3;Analysis completed. Incoherency detected.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_6_4;Cubes are designed to analyze, not to destroy.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_6_5;And multiple billions of dollars of damage!
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_6_6;These damage are involuntary. Your constructions lack resiliency.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_6_7;Wait! You mean it was not an attack?
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_6_8;Negative. This analysis took place to see and discover your world.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_6_9;The cubes’ internal code was a means for you to visit this world.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_6_10;And also project me as a semi-physical form to interact with your world.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_6_11;So, we fought... for nothing?
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_6_12;Negative. On the contrary, I discovered your method of communication through battle.
DialogPVE_Anniversary22_2_6_13;It seems... original. Deactivating all A027441.

Halloween_Super_Pack_description;This pack contain multiple Halloween-skinned mutants!
DialogPVE_Halloween22_1_1;To finish this special edition, another worrying event in our beautiful city.
DialogPVE_Halloween22_1_2;A new earthquake, with a magnitude beyond 5 has been felt around Genetic City
DialogPVE_Halloween22_1_3;The scientific community cannot give us an explanation about this phenomenon.
DialogPVE_Halloween22_1_4;Have you seen this?
DialogPVE_Halloween22_1_5;We’ve seen it, and we felt it as well... Didn’t you?
DialogPVE_Halloween22_1_6;Not at all, I’ve always been fond of good antiseismic systems.
DialogPVE_Halloween22_1_7;With the kind of mutants you have, it’s probably for the best...
DialogPVE_Halloween22_1_8;Though, it doesn’t look like normal earthquakes.
DialogPVE_Halloween22_1_9;According to my notes, it’s a bit East from the city. Not far from the old graveyard.
DialogPVE_Halloween22_1_10;Oh. I hate going there. There’s always this grim feeling...
DialogPVE_Halloween22_1_11;You should come along, Psy-Captain.
DialogPVE_Halloween22_2_1;I didn’t think there would be this much damage...
DialogPVE_Halloween22_2_2;It’s still an earthquake, Eva. Even at a low magnitude, these are strong phenomena.
DialogPVE_Halloween22_2_3;And they can easily aggravate existing damage on a building.
DialogPVE_Halloween22_2_4;I discovered that after one of my mutants had damaged a wall, a few years ago.
DialogPVE_Halloween22_2_5;Thus your antiseismic measures?
DialogPVE_Halloween22_2_6;Exactly. I’ve got interesting info from a guy from Genetic City University.
DialogPVE_Halloween22_2_7;What kind of information? About the earthquakes?
DialogPVE_Halloween22_2_8;Yes. It seems that, at the time the city became the world center for Mutant fighting,
DialogPVE_Halloween22_2_9;A team opposed to the project installed seismographic detectors all around the city
DialogPVE_Halloween22_2_10;Just so that they could demonstrate mutants were far too dangerous.
DialogPVE_Halloween22_2_11;We should look for these detectors. Psy-Captain, can you help us with it?
DialogPVE_Halloween22_3_1;Darwin, did you find out where the problem comes from? This graveyard’s quite dangerous!
DialogPVE_Halloween22_3_2;I’ve just collected data from the last seismograph.
DialogPVE_Halloween22_3_3;I just have to enter them in the calculator, and wait for the results.
DialogPVE_Halloween22_3_4;Will it take a long time? You’ve seen what attacked us!
DialogPVE_Halloween22_3_5;It should be pretty fast. We only have to wait for the triangulation to end.
DialogPVE_Halloween22_3_6;Why did we need to check over 10 seismographs? Three should’ve been enough!
DialogPVE_Halloween22_3_7;To make sure of the epicenter’s position, and avoid confusing it with something else.
DialogPVE_Halloween22_3_8;While we wait for the detailed calculation to end, we can start going this way.
DialogPVE_Halloween22_3_9;It’s the most dangerous place, Darwin... Are you really certain it’s that way?
DialogPVE_Halloween22_3_10;Completely. Psy-Captain, can you lead the way?
DialogPVE_Halloween22_4_1;I forgot how big this graveyard was!
DialogPVE_Halloween22_4_2;And I can confirm, the phenomenon clearly comes from here!
DialogPVE_Halloween22_4_3;You feel those tremors? It looks like the ground is vibrating!
DialogPVE_Halloween22_4_4;It’s more like if... the graveyard was alive.
DialogPVE_Halloween22_4_5;Or rather... like a massive mutant was close!
DialogPVE_Halloween22_4_6;What the... hell is that kind of creature ?
DialogPVE_Halloween22_4_7;When you were talking of a living graveyard, Darwin...
DialogPVE_Halloween22_4_8;You should have talked about an undead graveyard!
DialogPVE_Halloween22_4_9;Psy-Captain, this thing seems very dangerous! Quick, do something!
DialogPVE_Halloween22_5_1;Finally, that creature seems to be unable to move.
DialogPVE_Halloween22_5_2;I’ll take some samples, just to make sure...
DialogPVE_Halloween22_5_3;Yeah, I’m going to takes samples as well!
DialogPVE_Halloween22_5_4;You’d better talk about making a new mutant for battling...
DialogPVE_Halloween22_5_5;That’s closer to what I have in mind... I like its style.
DialogPVE_Halloween22_5_6;Please don’t start creating new earthquakes like these last days!
DialogPVE_Halloween22_5_7;No worries. I have my antiseismic systems in my lab!
DialogPVE_Halloween22_5_8;Everything will happen smoothly!
DialogPVE_Halloween22_5_9;I hope it will be the case, Urban... I hope it will...

DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_1_1;The blizzard is still intense over Genetic City
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_1_2;According to satellite imaging, it's likely this situation will last for at least a few more days.
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_1_3;That snowstorm is absolutely unbelievable. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_1_4;And I wanted to spend my holidays basking in the sun this year...
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_1_5;But airplanes cannot fly with this raging snowstorm!
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_1_6;Yes, there's only us both in the lab....
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_1_7;Wait. Are we even sure Darwin's ok ? 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_1_8;What do you mean? Wasn't he doing some research in some remote place, far from Genetic City?
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_1_9;Not at all. It was in some isolated place, but quite close from here!
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_1_10;He must be in the midst of the blizzard, without any communcation device!
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_1_11;Psy-Captain, get ready, we're going to check on him!
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_2_1;Missy, can you hear us?
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_2_2;Badly! What's happening?
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_2_3;We've got a problem. Darwin went on a field study despite the storm.
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_2_4;And we'd be grateful if you could lend us a hand. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_2_5;I'd be glad to, but I've got a lot of people to help around the city. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_2_6;There are many mutants that take advantage of the snow to sow chaos. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_2_7;I'm worried about him, but I cannot be everywhere at once. Sorry guys!
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_2_8;Back to square one. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_2_9;The only thing we can do is looking for him by ourselves. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_2_10;Let's go, Psy-Captain, there are a lot of mutants on our way. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_3_1;What a nonsense! We can barely move in the streets!
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_3_2;They did announce it in the weather report.
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_3_3;We never had such a blizzard since the big winter, when it was -30°C cold.
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_3_4;I was just a little girl at that time, I don't really remember. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_3_5;I only remember being very sick during that winter!
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_3_6;Talking about it will not make you get though the snow faster. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_3_7;You're right. We should drive through the city as fast as possible to find Darwin.
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_3_8;One day, I'll make him explain why he goes on field trips at the worst times!
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_4_1;Urban, is that me, or are we going in circles?
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_4_2;Wait... No. I don"t think so. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_4_3;Then tell me why I feel like we went multiple times through this street. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_4_4;Oh crap! The GPS system's looping endlessly due to the storm.
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_4_5;And we've been following some sort of loop in the city!
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_4_6;But why did it not just stop working?
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_4_7;If it cannot connect to the satellite. Yeah, it's not a normal thing!
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_4_8;There's probably something jamming the guiding system. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_4_9;And that's a very bad news if we want to find Darwin.
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_4_10;Psy-Captain, we absolutely need to find the jamming source!
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_5_1;Now that the mutant that jammed the GPS was put down...
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_5_2;We should be able to leave the city and find Darwin's cabin.

DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_5_4;All depends on what he's working on. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_5_5;Anyways, we won't get to him that easily.
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_5_6;Why? The GPS works correctly now. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_5_7;The storms looks denser in the direction we're going.
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_5_8;So, Darwin's closer to the center? 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_1_5_9;Sadly, yes...

DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_1_1;Darwin, do you receive our messages?
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_1_2;It's been hours since we started searching the area!
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_1_3;We're trying to find you! If you receive this message, please reach for us!
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_1_4;Tschhhhh...KRRRR...
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_1_5;Still nothing. It's illogical! 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_1_6;I only hope he's alright.
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_1_7;Me too.
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_1_8;And I don't like knowing he's alone in such a situation. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_1_9;Don't forget he's a field scientist, he can handle himself!
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_1_10;You're probably right. He can manage the minimum required.
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_1_11;At least, we have the Psy-Captain to deal with the mutants. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_2_1;What's this place? It's too calm. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_2_2;Far too calm. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_2_3;How is it possible everything is this calm in the middle of a blizzard?
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_2_4;Because... we're in the eye of the storm. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_2_5;A place around which winds blow quickly.
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_2_6;In which wind cannot be sustained, is that it?
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_2_7;Yes. And there's Darwin's cabin. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_2_8;On the darker side, comms still seem unstable. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_2_9;And I have the impression we could be attacked from any side. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_3_1;Finally! You are there!
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_3_2;And alive. I'm almost... surprised.
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_3_3;I've told you I would be doing my field study in here!
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_3_4;You're always doing studies, between the field and the lab. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_3_5;So, we did as usual. And given the intensity of the storm...
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_3_6;Is that why I couldn't get in touch with anyone these last few days?
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_3_7;Are you joking?
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_3_8;Yes. I saw the storm, but I couldn't do anything. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_3_9;I tried sheltering in the basement in case the roof would break. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_3_10;And avoiding the mutants living and moving in the storm as well.
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_3_11;About that, there's another pack gathering around here 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_4_1;Darwin, there is something I'd like you to explain. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_4_2;We're in the eye of the storm, but there are issues with communications.
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_4_3;Yes, it's one of the phenomena I wanted to study in here. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_4_4;It looks like there are some highly magnetic structures underground. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_4_5;So, it has some scientific interest, but being here prevents you from communicating? 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_4_6;That's it. But what is strange here is that the mineral deposits are... unconventional. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_4_7;Alien material? What would it do in here?
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_4_8;It may not be alien. But it has some particular magnetic properties. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_4_9;And it might be what happens to draw mutants around here. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_4_10;Like migratory birds? 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_4_11;Exactly. Except these ones are far more dangerous!
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_5_1;You have a worried look on your face, Darwin.
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_5_2;Can you tell us what is wrong?
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_5_3;It's not about you, don't worry. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_5_4;As you know, I came here to study this magnety anomaly. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_5_5;But I remarked some strange phenomenon. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_5_6;The storm seems to be focused around this specific area. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_5_7;And it has been lasting too long to be a normal snowstorm. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_5_8;So you think...
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_5_9;Yes, I think everything is linked to a mutant, that was drawn to this place. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_5_10;And that mutant concentrates the storm around it. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_5_11;If we get rid of it, could the storm stop?
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_5_12;Psy-Captain, you know what to do!
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_6_1;The storm seems to calm down...
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_6_2;Apparently, the mutant was more complex that what I thought...
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_6_3;It did, but it also matched your theory. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_6_4;Anyway, I have been able to confirm my initial observations. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_6_5;Always focused on research... Irreedeemable to the end. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_6_6;Sorry Eva. I cannot abandon my passion so easily. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_6_7;Thanks to you three for the rescue anyway, Eva, Urban, and the Psy-Captain. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_6_8;Urban, I think we should find a way to extract those minerals. 
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_6_9;If we could work on this together, we might be able to go 4 times as fast!
DialogPVE_Xmas22_2_6_10;Why not. I'm currently incubating a Soul Amalgamate...

DialogPVE_Valentines23_1_1;Good news, Psy Captain ! The Tournament of Love is back ! 
DialogPVE_Valentines23_1_2;I've registered you as a participant. You can't relax too much.
DialogPVE_Valentines23_1_3;Darwin and Urban went back in the area they discovered for Christmas. 
DialogPVE_Valentines23_1_4;It seems they wanted some samples ! 
DialogPVE_Valentines23_1_5;Anyway, this will take them quite a bit of time. 
DialogPVE_Valentines23_1_6;Though... That's not so bad. 
DialogPVE_Valentines23_1_7;It's going to be only the both of us, for once.

DialogPVE_Valentines23_4_2;New labs are starting to take interest in the mutant battling scene.

DialogPVE_Easter23_1_1;Psy Captain, I just received a message from Darwin ! 
DialogPVE_Easter23_1_2;No worries, both Urban and him are fine. 
DialogPVE_Easter23_1_3;But from what he told me, they need a hand with the excavation.
DialogPVE_Easter23_1_4;He says they have found very strange things. 
DialogPVE_Easter23_1_5;In particular, a massive complex of underground tunnels.
DialogPVE_Easter23_1_6;Anyway, prepare your backpack, your tent, and your headlamp...
DialogPVE_Easter23_1_7;We're exploring the depths! 
DialogPVE_Easter23_2_1;Ah! There you are at last! I thought you would never arrive!
DialogPVE_Easter23_2_2;Wait... Are you alone? Isn't Urban with you? 
DialogPVE_Easter23_2_3;No, I needed a break.
DialogPVE_Easter23_2_4;And I absolutely needed to calibrate a detector system. 
DialogPVE_Easter23_2_5;Urban used that time to scout ahead...
DialogPVE_Easter23_2_6;But now, it's been quite a while. 
DialogPVE_Easter23_2_7;He could have avoided leaving you alone. 
DialogPVE_Easter23_2_8;What would have happened if you had been attacked?
DialogPVE_Easter23_2_9;Not much, we prepared a sonic repulsive system. 
DialogPVE_Easter23_2_10;Anyway, my calibrations are over. I'm ready to go!
DialogPVE_Easter23_3_1;Urban! There you are! No injuries?
DialogPVE_Easter23_3_2;I'm fine. How did the tournament go?
DialogPVE_Easter23_3_3;It went well, but that's not the point!
DialogPVE_Easter23_3_4;Did you think it was a good idea to leave Darwin alone?
DialogPVE_Easter23_3_5;There are a lot of weird mutants in these caves!
DialogPVE_Easter23_3_6;Chill, Eva, Darwin's not a little kid. 
DialogPVE_Easter23_3_7;He had some defensive equipment. 
DialogPVE_Easter23_3_8;Probably not enough to fight, but enough to be safe. 
DialogPVE_Easter23_3_9;Come, I need to show you what I found!
DialogPVE_Easter23_4_1;Here is the discovery I just made!
DialogPVE_Easter23_4_2;What? That weird, viscous, bluish fluid? 
DialogPVE_Easter23_4_3;Yes. It's neither natural nor a local resource. 
DialogPVE_Easter23_4_4;I suspect an alien origin, given the color.
DialogPVE_Easter23_4_5;And given the quantity we found, there might be a structure further down...
DialogPVE_Easter23_4_6;It's clearly the strongest lead we have right now.
DialogPVE_Easter23_4_7;Let's follow that lead, now that we're all together!
DialogPVE_Easter23_5_1;Wow. What. Was. That. Animal? 
DialogPVE_Easter23_5_2;I'd say... some kind of rabbit, or hare, contaminated by the fluid. 
DialogPVE_Easter23_5_3;And indeed, it was very close to a solid structure.
DialogPVE_Easter23_5_4;To the touch, it feels metallic. And obviously artificial.
DialogPVE_Easter23_5_5;We need to find a door. 
DialogPVE_Easter23_5_6;Or at least, some sort of entry point. 
DialogPVE_Easter23_5_7;But either way, we'll have to go back to Genetic City.
DialogPVE_Easter23_5_8;We need some extra supplies, both food and material, to explore that. 
DialogPVE_Easter23_5_9;It will be good for us to take a break after these emotions!
DialogPVE_Easter23_5_10;I wouldn't mind seeing daylight again either!

DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_1_1;And for our special evening report, Trevor Reed!
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_1_2;Do you receive us Trevor? 
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_1_3;Yes, directly from the underground tunnels found by our team of genius scientists! 
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_1_4;We're about to enter this alien complex recently discovered.
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_1_5;Let's just hope there's no bad surprise waiting for us!
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_1_6;Reed! Your long-distance communication systems might trigger security measures!
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_1_7;Shut them off before we face killer robots!
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_1_8;Wh- What? Killer robots? I thought it was safe to be here!
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_1_9;It might not! But now is not the time to panic!
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_1_10;The connection seems to drop, we'll reach out to Reed later during our next edition!
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_2_1;Exactly what we wanted to avoid!
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_2_2;With your nonsense, the complex seems to have been reactivated.
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_2_3;That's pretty good news, isn't it? 
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_2_4;We will be able to meet alien lifeforms!
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_2_5;Yes. Or we will mee their weaponry, their prisons, and their experiments.
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_2_6;Oh. Right. I didn't really think about that. The idea of such a big news report...
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_2_7;By getting carried away like that, you end up doing stupid actions.
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_2_8;And that's how you trigger alarms!
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_2_9;Containment breach in area 3-7. Do not access the area. 
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_2_10;Well... this one was to be expected. And, it really took some time before it started...
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_2_11;Is it really our fault in that case ? 
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_3_1;The further we go, and the weirder it feels.
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_3_2;What? Exploring an underground alien complex, a few miles away from Genetic City?
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_3_3;You don't get it, Trevor. And yes, I agree with you Eva. 
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_3_4;That makes three of us. We're again dealing with that bluish fluid. It really comes from this complex. 
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_3_5;Worse than that. It seems able to contaminate creatures. So, don't touch it. 
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_3_6;I suppose we can forget trying to open that door then?
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_3_7;It's covered in oil. Nobody touches it. Especially you, Reed. 
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_3_8;We wouldn't want you to get hurt.
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_3_9;(And the last thing we want is for the expedition's funding to go up in smoke).
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_4_1;Is it OK? Nobody's covered in oil? 
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_4_2;No... But that alien... There's something strange about it. 
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_4_3;I don't remember anything about any mutant looking like that in both recent and older studies.
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_4_4;Do you think...
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_4_5;It's probably the leader of that complex. 
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_4_6;Hello dear Sir, you're in a Terran TV show, how do you feel about that?
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_4_7;REED!
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_4_8;Get down, quick!
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_4_9;Aaaaaahhh!
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_4_10;No choice here Psy Captain, we have to fight!
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_5_1;I think we're done here. Sadly, the oil touched pretty much all of the creatures.
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_5_2;Too bad for the encounters of the third kind. 
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_5_3;At least, we have a whole lot of technological devices to bring back to the lab for analysis. Right Darwin? 
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_5_4;We're gonna need multiple round trips to bring everything back, and years to analyze everything. 
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_5_5;You're exaggerating! Given the technology you have in your laboratory...
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_5_6;That's why we said years. And not "dozens of years".
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_5_7;Come on, let's get going, it'll take us until this evening to make the round trips! 
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_5_8;Reed! Don't stay behind ! I know you want to make extra sequences, but we really need to go. 
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_5_9;Sorry, I was filming some of the devices we found!
DialogPVE_PreAnniversary23_5_10;Anyway, this story will certainly get me a Pulitzer!

DialogPVE_Anniversary23_0_1;Psy Captain, I'm glad you're here. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_0_2;Things have started to become a little strange around here.
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_0_3;I'm not fully certain of what happens.
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_0_4;But everybody behaves in a weird way. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_0_5;As if... they had forgotten things. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_0_6;I'm going to investigate a bit, I'll be coming back if I manage to get some info. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_1_1;Hello Psy Captain! Did you manage to rest well? 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_1_2;With Urban, we prepared the next tournament for you. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_1_3;Your mutants are in great shape.
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_1_4;I heard there were new contestants in the tournament. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_1_5;Better be careful, some of them might be better than we expect. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_1_6;Urban is putting the finishing touch on a new machine. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_1_7;It should be ready after the qualifying rounds.
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_1_8;Good news, Missy's covering the tournament. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_1_9;It might finally be your moment!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_2_1;You're doing well! 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_2_2;Urban is back at last. With his... new machine.
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_2_3;(Wait, there's something wrong here...)
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_2_4;Look at this new invention!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_2_5;The Black Hole! It's made to recombinate all of your excess items!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_2_6;But... I feel like I've already told you that. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_2_7;A déjà-vu sensation? I've had that feeling for days. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_2_8;Whatever, I have good news for you!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_2_9;If you win the next round, you'll be interviewed by Missy herself!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_3_1;Good luck with your interview, don't let her intimidate you.
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_3_2;Hello dear Psy Captain! You advance at a remarkable pace on the circuit. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_3_3;Are you going to change your team before your next opponents?
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_3_4;What do you think about your current technical staff composition?
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_3_5;Here is the end of our interview with this new promising Psy Captain!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_3_6;You're advancing well in the tournament! I wish you good luck for the next part!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_3_7;(So, Psy Captain, I finally managed to understand something.)
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_3_8;(If Eva isn't here... It's because she never was. At least, not in this reality.)
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_3_9;(It appears that, 10 years ago, Urban failed his direct attack against her.)
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_3_10;(Thus, the world evolved... differently.)
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_3_11;Are you done with the interview? Can we get back to work?
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_3_12;The tournament won't win itself. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_4_1;Oh no! Eva Destruction is once again in finals. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_4_2;Again? But we never stood a chance against her!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_4_3;Hello, losers! Did you finally manage to find a new challenger?
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_4_4;Good for me, a new training dummy for my mutants. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_4_5;You... You don't know what the Psy Captain is made of!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_4_6;If I look at your team... On one side, the junk scientist who never achieved a thing...
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_4_7;And the guy who was permanently banned from competitions for hitting a referee, 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_4_8;While he was attempting to target me...
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_4_9;It's one hell of a team! Ouch... My head! Damn these headaches!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_4_10;Looks like she's not in her best shape, you might have a chance today. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_5_1;You're doing well, Psy Captain!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_5_2;It's been a while since the last time someone bested me. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_5_3;We told you, Miss Destruction! Our champion is invincible!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_5_4;By the way, Missy's coming around for another interview!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_5_5;Hello! You just won the tournament by defeating Eva Destruction!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_5_6;What are your first impressions after this victory against the current champion?
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_5_7;Thanks for the show you offered our spectators during the tournament!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_5_8;(On a more serious note, I understood what happened.)
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_5_9;(Eva should have lost her abilities 10 years ago against Urban.)
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_5_10;(That specific event changed, and both their stories, minds and behaviour changed drastically.)
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_5_11;(And something scares me here. The butterfly effect.)
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_5_12;(If a single event changed the world so much...)
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_1_5_13;(Nothing says the consequences won't be even worse.)

DialogPVE_Anniversary23_0_7;What I feared has just started. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_0_8;Other changes happened. I'll keep in touch. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_1_1;Psy Captain! Hopefully you're here!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_1_2;I thought something happened to you.
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_1_3;With all the wandering mechanical creatures in Genetic City, 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_1_4;There was a risk for you to get attacked.
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_1_5;After all, there are multiple robotic troops attacking each other.
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_1_6;But don't worry about that now. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_1_7;You have an elite tournament to prepare! 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_1_8;Apparently, Eva wants her revenge against you.
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_1_9;Get your mutants ready, we're off to the arena!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_2_1;You're quite competent for a mere Psy Captain!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_2_2;In another life, we might have become friends.
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_2_3;Ouch! These headaches again! And once again, while you're around!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_2_4;You did try to do something to me, didn't you?
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_2_5;That's why I keep losing against you!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_2_6;Psy Captain! Miss Destruction! The robotic troops are getting close to the arena!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_2_7;So soon? But we reduced the number of challengers on purpose!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_2_8;They're finding us faster every time!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_2_9;Wait, wasn't it supposed to be an elite tournament, officially approved?
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_2_10;You're being naive. You know the situation as well as I do.
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_2_11;Anyway, you'd rather run away quickly if you don't want to meet your end. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_2_12;Psy Captain? I think we won't have any choice but to fight...
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_3_1;Thanks a lot Missy! I didn't think you would have saved us.
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_3_2;I wouldn't let you both in such danger!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_3_3;Plus, I really needed to have a talk with the Psy Captain.
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_3_4;Do you really think that's the time for an interview?
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_3_5;Especially since Baron Urban put his great plan in action!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_3_6;What plan are you talking about? I must have missed something.
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_3_7;When he exposed Professor Mutenstein as an evil mastermind. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_3_8;When he made a troop of mutant clones based on his own DNA.
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_3_9;Speaking of mutants... It's time to move again!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_3_10;Psy Captain, Darwin! Things are gonna get shaky!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_4_1;I finally managed to catch the underground Psy Captains!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_4_2;Underground? Psy Captains can do whatever they want!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_4_3;They can take part in the leagues and tournaments of their choosing!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_4_4;No ! Psy Captains take part in MY LEAGUE!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_4_5;The Genetic City Urban Championship? That rigged league where you crush them?
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_4_6;Only Psy Captains with MY approval can take part in it! 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_4_7;You've gone completely nuts, Urban. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_4_8;It's not your fault. We're going to fix this...
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_4_9;Not so fast! Here's a special invitation for an immediate event!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_4_10;So, LET THE BATTLE BEGIN! HAHAHAHA!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_5_1;NOOOOOOO! Since when do Psy Captains fight back?
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_5_2;HE promised me a perpetual streak of victories! It cannot stop like this!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_5_3;This won't be the last fight! Just give me some time to rebuild new mutants!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_5_4;If you want, Urban! Take care while coming back home!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_5_5;There it is. I finally made a choice. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_5_6;What decision? Don't tell me...
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_5_7;I've lost my scientific role model. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_5_8;I'm chased by his former aide who's destroying everything in his way. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_5_9;And now I'm alone handling everything for a Psy Captain. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_5_10;I'm sorry, guys, but it's too much for me. I'm done. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_5_11;We're the only ones left... We're going to need allies. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_5_12;And what Urban said is troubling me... Someone is behind this whole story.
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_5_13;We will need to ask questions to some people.
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_2_5_14;And these people are probably the last I want to meet now.

DialogPVE_Anniversary23_0_9;Let's sum things up. We know that the past has been modified. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_0_10;We also know it had an effect on Eva and Urban, as well as their stories.
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_0_11;Mutenstein must be somewhere behind that. He's the only one able to go that far.
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_1_1;Genetic City News ! Be careful, strange things happen in town!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_1_2;The reality alterations start to have violent consequences. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_1_3;And reality sometimes even starts to break...
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_1_4;But I'm still annoyed by this Mutenstein story. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_1_5;His whole plan backfired... That doesn't sound like him. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_1_6;Urban not changing sides wouldn't have had that effect. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_1_7;We have to go and talk to him. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_1_8;He might be able to tell us how he did start this...
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_1_9;Let's stay careful, Psy-Captain. Genetic City's become quite dangerous these last days...
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_2_1;Mutenstein ! I know I would find you here. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_2_2;Missy ! Are you here for an interview? 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_2_3;You know, since all the trouble caused by Urban, I limited my research.
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_2_4;Really? What about those mechanical arms? Who did install them?
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_2_5;I don't know;.. Your friend, the young red-haired scientist?
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_2_6;Darwin? He took some vacation. And he has nothing to do with all this. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_2_7;Oh, I see... He couldn't bear the pressure. Poor little one.
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_2_8;Not everyone's a fighter, Mutenstein. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_2_9;I think we should talk again later.
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_2_10;There's a group of mutants closing on us, and I don't want to end up like junk metal...
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_2_11;Psy-Captain, I'll help as best as I can, but they are numerous.
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_3_1;Things seem calmer. But you don't, Missy... I get the feeling you hold some grudge...
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_3_2;Really? Do you not understand what is happening?
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_3_3;Understand, I do. There are deep fractures into the fabric of reality.
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_3_4;Wait! Do you mean that...
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_3_5;Exactly. We are in an altered reality. How did you do that?
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_3_6;If only I knew... Sadly for you, I am not connected to this. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_3_7;I wouldn't have altered reality without staying aware of it. That would be nonsensical!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_3_8;But if it's not you... Who's behind all this?
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_3_9;Despite my inability to answer that question, I might help you looking for an answer.
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_3_10;As well as a way to put things back in order. Before reality crumbles.
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_3_11;Could you please bring me back some kind of research assistant, like your friend Darwin. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_3_12;Psy-Captain, let's go find him!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_4_1;There's the young scientist...
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_4_2;Pl-pleased to meet you, Professor Mutenstein. I am...
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_4_3;Darwin, I know. We don't have time to spare. And I know you weren't that thrilled to come.
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_4_4;We had to kick his ass into going here !
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_4_5;If I did understand Missy, we need to find a way to "fix" reality?
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_4_6;That's it. You have seen all these fissures and lights everywhere. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_4_7;We need to find the culprit, and devise something able to revert all damage he caused.
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_4_8;And without too many consequences if possible...
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_4_9;(And at the same time, I'm annoyed, this Mutenstein seems less... evil than usual.)
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_4_10;Urban did talk about someone. But he never told us who that person was.
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_4_11;It's time for some questioning...
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_5_1;It's no use hitting me. I will not answer. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_5_2;What if I beam down all your clones?
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_5_3;No! Not my clones! I spent so much time on them!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_5_4;And they're finally functional! Don't be so cruel!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_5_5;You leave us no choice, Urban. We need to know who's behind all this!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_5_6;Fine. That person is...
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_5_7;...
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_5_8;Urban? Why are you not talking?
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_5_9;I fear he has been... deactivated.
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_5_10;What? Who did it? And why?
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_5_11;I wouldn't let a third-rate villain under my spotlight!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_5_12;If you want to know who I am... Find me where everything began.
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_5_13;Especially you, Psy-Captain. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_6_1;Hello dear Psy-Captain!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_6_2;And thanks all of you who went to the show
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_6_3;OF YOUR DEMISE!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_6_4;Plus, you came with Missy and Mutenstein. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_6_5;It's ab-so-lu-te-ly PERFECT!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_6_6;Am I hallucinating?? Trevor?
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_6_7;I will get rid of you three...
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_6_8;And finally I will be the hero everyone is waiting for!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_7_1;No... NO !
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_7_2;I should have won! Everything was planned!
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_7_3;You cannot plan for the unpredicatable, Trevor. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_7_4;Damn this alien thingy... I would have gotten my own place in this story
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_7_5;Alien thingy? Did you steal alien tech in the complex?
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_7_6;A little something... But it didn't work as well as I expected...
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_7_7;Anyway, I no longer have it. I still have one part, the other one broke. 
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_7_8;Darwin, Professor, I hope you would be able to revert things back.
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_7_9;If we have at least a part of the original device, it should work...
DialogPVE_Anniversary23_3_7_10;I certainly hope so...

DialogPVE_Halloween23_1_1;So, Urban, no big Halloween tournament for you this year? 
DialogPVE_Halloween23_1_2;No, after the events of this summer, I'd rather take a break. 
DialogPVE_Halloween23_1_3;And if I'm not there, you'll be eating all the candy again. 
DialogPVE_Halloween23_1_4;News of the day - The Halloween delinquent has struck again! 
DialogPVE_Halloween23_1_5;Find out more in today's edition. 
DialogPVE_Halloween23_1_6;What kind of story is this? 
DialogPVE_Halloween23_1_7;Apparently, some idiot is causing all kinds of trouble under the guise of Halloween. 
DialogPVE_Halloween23_1_8;Not really our concern, is it? 
DialogPVE_Halloween23_1_9;And our subject for today, the Halloween delinquent! 
DialogPVE_Halloween23_1_10;According to our latest information and testimonies, a mutant is behind this story! 
DialogPVE_Halloween23_1_11;That's our area of expertise! Psy-Captain, head for Genetic City's cemetery district!
DialogPVE_Halloween23_2_1;I know I say this every year, but couldn't we go somewhere nicer?
DialogPVE_Halloween23_2_2;Something happier, more colorful... Less gloomy? 
DialogPVE_Halloween23_2_3;And miss the chance to see you in a panic? No way! 
DialogPVE_Halloween23_2_4;We should be looking instead of nagging each other. 
DialogPVE_Halloween23_2_5;For one thing, it would help Darwin get home faster. 
DialogPVE_Halloween23_2_6;And for another, we could all have a Pumpkin Spice Latte on the way home! 
DialogPVE_Halloween23_2_7;Great idea! Let's interview the residents and keep an eye out for mutants. 
DialogPVE_Halloween23_2_8;And don't overdo it, Urban! 
DialogPVE_Halloween23_2_9;No, you know me well.
DialogPVE_Halloween23_2_10;Exactly! Psy-Captain, take care of East Street.
DialogPVE_Halloween23_3_1;Hey, Psy-Captain, what are you doing here? 
DialogPVE_Halloween23_3_2;Still investigating strange Halloween phenomena?
DialogPVE_Halloween23_3_3;Or is it just that Halloween delinquent might be a mutant? 
DialogPVE_Halloween23_3_4;Well, I finished my tour, and I didn't find anything. 
DialogPVE_Halloween23_3_5;Same here. 
DialogPVE_Halloween23_3_6;Same for me.
DialogPVE_Halloween23_3_7;Hi Missy, are you doing your research on this mutant too? 
DialogPVE_Halloween23_3_8;Yes, I'd like to find him soon. Apparently, he's wearing a pumpkin costume.
DialogPVE_Halloween23_3_9;Pumpkin? That should be easy to find! We're going back!
DialogPVE_Halloween23_4_1;We looked everywhere, and still nothing. 
DialogPVE_Halloween23_4_2;For my part, I made an aerial survey and saw a couple of moving pumpkins. 
DialogPVE_Halloween23_4_3;Where are they? 
DialogPVE_Halloween23_4_4;Opposite the cemetery. And that's where I saw the most damage. 
DialogPVE_Halloween23_4_5;So no time to lose, that mutant's got to be there! 
DialogPVE_Halloween23_4_6;Let's be careful, Urban, he could be dangerous. What kind of damage, Missy?
DialogPVE_Halloween23_4_7;Damage to houses mainly. Pranks that have gone too far. 
DialogPVE_Halloween23_4_8;And you're sure it's not children? 
DialogPVE_Halloween23_4_9;Given the damage... Not a chance.
DialogPVE_Halloween23_5_1;Ouuuuuuuuch! You're mean!
DialogPVE_Halloween23_5_2;Just stop causing trouble!
DialogPVE_Halloween23_5_3;You're all going to die! 
DialogPVE_Halloween23_5_4;Yes, but not now. 
DialogPVE_Halloween23_5_5;I'll get my revenge! 
DialogPVE_Halloween23_5_6;And we'll be there to stop you! 
DialogPVE_Halloween23_5_7;Why is this mutant behaving like a child?
DialogPVE_Halloween23_5_8;I'm not sure. Does it look like some kind of trickster spirit? 
DialogPVE_Halloween23_5_9;A Halloween spirit... Imitating children and their behavior...

This embodiment of Trick or Treats imitates childish behaviour at Halloween time to collect candy and and make cruel (and sometimes deadly) pranks at the expense of all others...

caption_mission_xmas23_1_3;If Mutenstein is delivering the gifts, he must have deliverymen!
caption_mission_xmas23_1_4;Let's follow the footprints back to the trail! 
caption_mission_xmas23_1_5;The streets of Genetic City are full of mutants! 
caption_mission_xmas23_1_6;Mutenstein's gifts contain all sorts of objects. Let's analyze them!
caption_mission_xmas23_1_7;Research takes time. But it's also about gaining knowledge and experience. 
caption_mission_xmas23_1_8;Let's get back to the lab and take care of your mutants. 
caption_mission_xmas23_1_9;Back to the lab, maybe you need to create some new mutants. 
caption_mission_xmas23_1_10;Some Psy-Captains want to take you on in the streets! 
caption_mission_xmas23_1_11;We've got to make our mark... and do a lot of damage! 
caption_mission_xmas23_1_12;We've got to explore every possible lead, even if it's the wrong one.
caption_mission_xmas23_1_13;Prepare your mutants for infiltration
caption_mission_xmas23_1_14;It's time to get your gear ready for infiltration!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_1_1;Mutenstein is back, and on all channels. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_1_2;Yes, I noticed, with his famous gifts. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_1_3;I can't help thinking he's hiding something. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_1_4;It's obvious, but how can we prove it? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_1_5;First, we'd have to get our hands on those presents. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_1_6;That's already been done. And they're nothing special.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_1_7;We told you not to buy them, Darwin. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_1_8;That was... for research! Not for fun! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_1_9;Nobody believes that... In any case, we won't find anything by staying here in the lab. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_1_10;Direction: the streets of Genetic City. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_1_11;Come on, Psy-Captain, we've got some clues to find.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_2_1;Let's take a brief look at the situation. We fought a few mutants on the loose. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_2_2;I got my hands on a few gifts and analyzed them without opening them. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_2_3;That's nice. What about you, Urban? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_2_4;A few fights, nothing unusual. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_2_5;I went round the stores to see if anything strange had happened. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_2_6;And I took the opportunity to get some chocolates. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_2_7;Was that really necessary? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_2_8;No, but they're so good. Hahaha! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_2_9;We need to find out where these gifts came from. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_2_10;Yes, but we can't use a tracer that would go back in time...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_2_11;Let's keep looking, Psy-Captain. We're bound to find something!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_3_1;I suppose you've been shopping for chocolates again?  
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_3_2;Not at all, we just came back early. Because we had an idea. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_3_3;An idea? Like taking a break and enjoying Christmas? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_3_4;Why wouldn't we? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_3_5;You're not there at all, Eva. We were just thinking the same thing at the same time. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_3_6;We need to get our hands on one of Mutenstein's delivery people. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_3_7;From what I've heard, Mutenstein's delivery crew may be mutants. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_3_8;And that's why we didn't come across them - we were looking for human deliverymen! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_3_9;So if we find one of these delivery mutants, we'll be able to follow the trail!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_3_10;Psy-Captain, it's off to hunt for deliverymen!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_4_1;Great, we've found a mutant courier! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_4_2;Yes, but apart from a bunch of gift boxes...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_4_3;We didn't get anything useful out of it. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_4_4;Well, maybe not. Given that this mutant has a hood and big legs...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_4_5;It must be pretty heavy and leave a lot of tracks in its wake!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_4_6;We'd have to follow the footprints all the way back to where the gifts were made! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_4_7;Exactly! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_4_8;We're off! Psy-Captain, prepare yourself just in case! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_4_9;There could be another Mutenstein-developed mutant on the loose!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_5_1;Psy-Captain, you came on a bit strong! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_5_2;I admit, maybe we shouldn't have attacked that delivery mutant so violently. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_5_3;Besides, it's not going to help us... Except that now we've got a sleighload of presents. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_5_4;Let's rummage around... You never know. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_5_5;Nothing for me. I'm going to move on to opening presents. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_5_6;Nothing for me either. Ah, wait, I just found something weird... 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_5_7;It looks like some kind of access pass... With an address: 3197, Michigan Street... 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_5_8;According to my GPS app, it's in Genetic City. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_5_9;That must be the warehouse address! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_5_10;Possibly... But we'll have to prepare properly. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_5_11;This is the first time we've done this kind of infiltration... So let's take our time. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_1_5_12;And anyway, we're not equipped for the moment.

caption_mission_xmas23_2_10;Add colorful ribbons...

DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_1_4;Yes, I've got all the camouflage gear. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_1_5;And I've got the jammers for the cameras. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_1_6;Is everyone ready? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_1_7;Have you forgotten me? You think I can't help you? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_1_8;Since you're a public figure, we thought...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_1_9;That I wouldn't come? When there's a way to bring this lunatic down?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_1_10;We'll be a little less discreet, but it might help if there's any danger. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_1_11;Come on, Psy-Captain, we'll let you lead the way. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_2_1;One good thing done, here we are in the factory. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_2_2;And from what I can see, this delivery area is... densely populated? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_2_3;Yes, and above all, there are only mutants, not a single human. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_2_4;Mutenstein has always put more trust in his creations than in uncontrollable humans.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_2_5;Yes, I've paid the price... 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_2_6;Sorry to remind you, Missy. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_2_7;The best thing would be to sneak through the aisles and fight as little as possible. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_2_8;As little as possible? Shouldn't we try not to fight at all? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_2_9;That would be ideal, but there are so many mutants, we won't have much choice. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_2_10;And the good thing is that there's enough noise in the factory that the sound of a fight won't get us spotted. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_3_1;We've just crossed the delivery zone. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_3_2;I thought it wouldn't be as busy as this...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_3_3;At least the only mutants who spotted us have been defeated. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_3_4;By the way, shouldn't we take care of security before we go any further? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_3_5;What do you mean, security? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_3_6;There must be a security control room somewhere! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_3_7;If it follows the classic Mutenstein building model, it must be somewhere at the top of this ramp.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_3_8;How long have you known about their design? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_3_9;Since I worked for him once...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_3_10;That's right, I'd forgotten about it. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_3_11;Psy-Captain, we've got to deal with that security before we can move on. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_4_1;I didn't expect this. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_4_2;Security made entirely of mutants, and right in the middle of Genetic City. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_4_3;Does that really surprise you? We're talking about Mutenstein! Not some mobster. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_4_4;And I don't think we've seen the last of him. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_4_5;Old Mutenstein is far more resourceful than he lets on...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_4_6;And here I thought he'd invested most of his money in the Fosse.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_4_7;I guess he's got even more than he bargained for... 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_4_8;Of course, it seems he has an unlimited source of funds... 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_4_9;Here we are in the next room. Woah! Toys everywhere! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_4_10;I feel like a child again when I see this! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_4_11;As long as it's just an impression... Watch out for mutants disguised as toys!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_5_1;Phew... finally out of this hell! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_5_2;Darwin? I didn't expect such a reaction from you! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_5_3;Don't you like toys? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_5_4;Yes, but not in a factory made by Mutenstein, and with the risk of being captured...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_5_5;I suppose it fits in with his strategy of looking like a nice guy to everyone.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_5_6;On the other hand, did he have to dress up as Santa Claus? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_5_7;I guess it motivates all the mutants who work for him. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_5_8;Not to mention the messages broadcast non-stop...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_5_9;By the way, here come some more of Mutenstein's elves, we're going to have to defend ourselves!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_5_10;Psy-Captain, it's time to deploy your mutants! Missy, find us a way out! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_6_1;Always mutants in purple hats... 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_6_2;Mutenstein has really decided to play Santa this year... 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_6_3;Yes, I think so... 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_6_4;And what worries me most is not knowing what's behind it...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_6_5;Yes, that's why we're here! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_6_6;I think we've reached the factory's main hall.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_6_7;We'll finally get to see how he makes his famous capsules.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_6_8;And above all, we're going to see what Machiavellian plans they're hiding! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_6_9;I can see a big capsule machine over there!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_6_10;But it's crawling with mutants.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_6_11;I suppose we'll have to force our way in? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_6_12;Probably. Psy-Captain, Urban, we're counting on you two!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_7_1;Bravo! Bravo! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_7_2;Mutenstein? Can you see us?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_7_3;That's right, my dear friends! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_7_4;How did you find us? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_7_5;I've been watching you since you started your infiltration, hehehe! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_7_6;But I don't understand, what about the camera jammers? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_7_7;Do you really think I hadn't taken precautions against snoopers?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_7_8;I'd already installed special cameras using anti-jamming systems. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_7_9;I should have known better... It was a trap, wasn't it?  
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_7_10;Yes, it was. You've just destroyed many gifts for the people of Genetic City. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_7_11;And it's all been recorded!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_7_12;So I expect some... cooperation from you over the next few months. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_7_13;The deceiver! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_7_14;That is, if you want to keep your freedom of movement! Merry Christmas, HO-HO-HO!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas23_2_7_15;No choice, we may have to work for him...

Grid_42;2024 Events
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_1_1;And tonight we welcome the famous Professor Mutenstein! 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_1_2;Good evening Professor, what good news have you brought us this time? 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_1_3;Good evening Trevor, I'm not bringing you anything incredible about my current research.
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_1_4;However, I'm here to make an announcement relating to the Christmas incidents.
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_1_5;Ah, yes, when a Psy-Captain and his entourage devastated one of your factories.
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_1_6;For a long time, I hesitated to take legal action, but I've decided to be magnanimous.
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_1_7;Magnanimous? In what way?
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_1_8;Instead of resenting them, I took the initiative of taking them under my wings and mentoring them. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_1_9;And so, I'm going to be their exclusive sponsor for this annual Valentine's Day tournament.
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_1_10;They're a lucky bunch, if you put all your resources behind them.
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_1_11;I have no doubts about their success. In fact, I think they're about to enter the competition. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_1_12;Let's wish them and all their opponents the best of luck!
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_2_1;At last we come face to face...
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_2_2;I'm glad to see you're all well. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_2_3;I don't know what you're up to, Professor, but we won't stand for it. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_2_4;Scheming? Me? I'm not that kind of guy. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_2_5;What do you want from us? And why did you sponsor us?
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_2_6;You see, I need a competent Psy-Captain to defend my interests.
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_2_7;And you happen to be competent, organized...
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_2_8;And that we are indebted to him if we don't want to end up in front of a judge. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_2_9;That's right, Darwin. And it allows me to keep an eye on you too. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_2_10;I should have known better... 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_2_11;The objective is simple. Win this tournament.
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_2_12;Anyway, the next round's about to start.
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_3_1;I congratulate you on your progress. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_3_2;It still doesn't tell us what's behind all this. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_3_3;For the moment, the details of my involvement don't concern you. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_3_4;As long as you don't reach the heights of the tournament anyway. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_3_5;So we're just good enough to be your lapdogs? 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_3_6;It would only be a return to normal for some of you...
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_3_7;I'm going to...
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_3_8;Calm down Urban, he's provoking you on purpose, and hitting him wouldn't help. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_3_9;Instead, save your energy for this round, and I'll tell you a little more.
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_4_1;That's it, Mutenstein, the round's over, and we've qualified for the finals. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_4_2;So it's time for a little explanation. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_4_3;More on that? All right, I'll explain. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_4_4;As you may have noticed, new forms of certain mutants have appeared. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_4_5;Yes, they're so cute! 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_4_6;Exactly, and I suppose it has something to do with a creature that escaped from one of my laboratories. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_4_7;I think it reacted to the ubiquity of hearts and romantic manifestations. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_4_8;However, she seems to have unpredictably mutated some mutants. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_4_9;And I think she may want to extend her reach. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_4_10;Wait, the mutant is going to attack humans? 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_4_11;Probably, yes. So I'd like you to capture it in the final phase.
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_5_1;There, Professor, a mutant captured and retrieved for you. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_5_2;A bit like the old days... I didn't miss doing that. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_5_3;Very well, your objective is accomplished. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_5_4;Consider the first part of your debt discharged. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_5_5;I'll certainly need you again in a few weeks' time. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_5_6;Feel free to hone your skills in the meantime. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_5_7;In particular, your investigation and infiltration techniques. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_5_8;What are you going to ask us to do? 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_5_9;I'll tell you in due time, my dear Eva. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines24_5_10;And you, Psy-Captain, enjoy your tournament victory for the time being.

DialogPVE_Event_easter24_1_1;Here you are at last! I thought your plane would never get here! 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_1_2;Professor Mutenstein... I thought you weren't coming to the tournament.
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_1_3;Indeed, I had planned not to interfere. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_1_4;Until I learned that, in parallel with the tournament, new excavations were taking place. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_1_5;Ah, yes, the dig organized by DNA University in Detroit. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_1_6;I didn't pay much attention, they had some fancy theories about ancient astronauts. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_1_7;That's what I thought too. But one of my contacts gave me some new information. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_1_8;And what's our role in all this? 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_1_9;I'd like you to go to the dig site in parallel with the tournament.
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_1_10;Collect information? 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_1_11;Information, samples, photos. I want to know everything. And don't draw too much attention to yourself!
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_2_1;Mutenstein could have warned us!
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_2_2;That the dig site was in an area of high mutant activity?
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_2_3;Why do you think he sent us instead of others? 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_2_4;Because we've got no choice but to play stooge for that madman!
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_2_5;Quiet! We risk being spotted if you open your mouth too much about him. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_2_6;It's all right, we've got a cover. After all, the Psy-Captain once fought in Detroit. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_2_7;At the very beginning of his career, yes. That should be enough for a start. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_2_8;And we can always talk about a ride alongside the Rapa Nui tournament. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_2_9;That's why you can't be trusted to go undercover, Urban.
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_2_10;It's a good thing the tournament got most of their teams off site. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_3_1;What the hell was that? Since when can Easter Island moais move?  
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_3_2;I guess that's what Mutenstein wanted us to investigate. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_3_3;Are they mutants? Or some other as-yet-unknown type of creature? 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_3_4;We'd have to come across more like them. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_3_5;I didn't have my equipment to hand during the fight. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_3_6;Usually, I have time to set everything up before we come across any strange creatures. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_3_7;But here, with the rush and the risk of getting caught...
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_3_8;In short, you were scared to death, so you didn't have your gear! Bravo Darwin! 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_3_9;We could have wrapped it up quickly, but no...
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_3_10;There's no need to pick on him. I think we're all very nervous.
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_3_11;I'm going to take out the lighter version of my equipment, it's easier to deploy. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_4_1;Did you get the data on this one? 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_4_2;Yes, and it's already been sent to Mutenstein. He's supposed to contact us via a video call.
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_4_3;*I can see you now! Reception's lousy here... 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_4_4;I've received your report, Darwin. The data is *rcrt*. But insufficient. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_4_5;For one thing, you mentioned another moai, for which I would have *crzt* information. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_4_6;There, I told you not to mention it! 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_4_7;On the other hand, the readings you've sent me don't match *zzcrt*
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_4_8;*crztt* seismic activity *zztcr* variable magnitude *zzt*
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_4_9;He wants us to keep looking for something. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_4_10;And he won't give us a break until we've finished with these moais. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_4_11;The more time we spend here, the more I get the feeling they're watching us...
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_4_12;Yeah, it's getting almost... disturbing. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_5_1;Now I understand why he was talking about earthquakes! 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_5_2;This moai totally had a huge body buried under the ground! 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_5_3;Is this what the Detroit boys were looking for here? 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_5_4;Probably... Very probably. Darwin, have you finished with your samples? 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_5_5;Yes, we can send it all to Mutenstein! 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_5_6;Not "everything", Darwin. Let's keep some things for ourselves, just in case. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_5_7;At worst, we can always use them to develop our own mutants.
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_5_8;And at best, we'll have some leverage against that crazy old man if things go wrong. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_5_9;I like the way you think, Eva. You're getting better and better at investigating and infiltrating! 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_5_10;Don't flatter yourself, Urban. I don't expect Mutenstein to stop. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter24_5_11;Well... not yet. And I think he's many steps ahead of us.

DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_1_1;Good evening Missy! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_1_2;Good evening Trevor!
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_1_3;And good evening to all of you gathered here in the Genetic City Multisports Arena! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_1_4;And to all our viewers, of course!
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_1_5;We've been commissioned by our beloved network to follow this incredible event!
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_1_6;The official start of Mr. Eldritch von Mutenstein's campaign
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_1_7;Better known to our listeners as Professor Mutenstein. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_1_8;This mutant specialist has organized an extraordinary event to launch his campaign! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_1_9;Will he succeed? Or on the contrary, could such an outpouring of resources do him any harm? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_1_10;We'll be asking him lots of questions in an interview right after his speech.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_1_11;But before that, a host of guests, and mutant battles for all! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_1_12;In particular, one of the hottest Psy-Captains of his generation enters the fray right now!
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_2_1;I'm now approaching our Psy-Captain's staff, hoping he'll be available between games. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_2_2;On the face of it, his staff seems to be present, and I can recognize his coach, the wonderful Eva Destruction. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_2_3;Good evening Trevor. Still poking around the dressing rooms?
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_2_4;(We're live, Eva!) 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_2_5;Good evening Eva, I wasn't expecting to run into you so quickly. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_2_6;And yet here we are, Urban, Darwin, and me. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_2_7;What made you decide to support Professor Mutenstein despite your past differences? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_2_8;Oh, you know, we can't stay opposites forever when the Professor has so much influence. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_2_9;To antagonize him would be to risk the evolution of our team on the circuit.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_2_10;But how? Would there be any pressure from our candidate? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_2_11;No, not at all. It would simply be foolish of us not to take advantage of his sponsorship. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_2_12;It looks like the break is about to end, and after the next few matches I'll be back on set. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_3_1;Bravo Eva, I wondered if you weren't going to betray our agreement. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_3_2;Given what awaits us if we do, you can imagine that it would be very damaging. For all of us.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_3_3;Myself included. And as you said yourself, this sponsorship deal is very profitable. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_3_4;It won't be long before I have to go on stage, and I'll have to improve this speech still further. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_3_5;I don't want to give the wrong impression about the policy I want to pursue in this city. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_3_6;And my advisors are as dumb as a bunch of monkeys today. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_3_7;It's probably their mutations that make them aggressive in this fighting environment. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_3_8;At the same time, considering what you've put them through...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_3_9;Some of my creations are in the arena today, so try not to damage them too much. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_4_1;We're back on set for a live interview with one of our champion's former adversaries.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_4_2;He now spends most of his time on his close staff, the specialist in manufacturing... 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_4_3;Baron Urban! Let's hear it for him! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_4_4;Good evening Missy, Trevor...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_4_5;You don't seem as comfortable in front of the camera as you were at the peak of your career. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_4_6;No, it's not so much that, it's more the overall situation that bothers me. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_4_7;Would you like to tell us more? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_4_8;Not really, it's personal stuff, but I think once we've solved it, we'll all have a good laugh. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_4_9;And what about your support for Professor Mutenstein? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_4_10;Oh, he and I have quite a complex relationship. Mentor-student, sponsor... 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_4_11;You mean you've never really been able to leave his side? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_4_12;Well, in a way... Wait, is the Psy-Captain the one who's in trouble in his fight? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_4_13;Not at all, Urban, it's another Psy-Ca... Apparently, he left the set in a hurry. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_5_1;Where are you now, Missy? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_5_2;Well, my dear Trevor, I'm currently in the company of young scientist Darwin. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_5_3;An eminent member of our champion's staff, from the very beginning.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_5_4;Don't overdo it, I'm just the head scientist... 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_5_5;And without you, our champion wouldn't be able to incubate or hybridize mutants! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_5_6;You're an essential member of your team, Darwin!
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_5_7;Er, thank you... 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_5_8;But tell me, Darwin, why are you backing candidate Mutenstein today? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_5_9;Well, he's always been something of a scientific target for me. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_5_10;I wish things had gone better, but...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_5_11;In a better way? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_5_12;Sorry, I've said too much, I've got to go! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_5_13;The mystery deepens, my dear Trevor! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_6_1;After these quick interviews, we're nearing the end of this introductory tournament. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_6_2;Professor Mutenstein is in the gallery, apparently still making corrections to his speech.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_6_3;Now he's grumbling about his staff, and in particular his personal bodyguard. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_6_4;We didn't mention this, by the way, but the Professor's staff are all mutants! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_6_5;Multiple species of classic mutants, but also new variants, adapted to the political context! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_6_6;And yet, he hasn't selected any human assistants for his staff, a very bold choice on his part. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_6_7;That shouldn't surprise you so much, Trevor.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_6_8;Oh, really? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_6_9;We all know that Mutenstein has always preferred the company of mutants! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_6_10;Will this shine through in his program and opening speech? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_6_11;The answer, in a few minutes on your screens!
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_7_1;And here we are at the moment we've all been waiting for! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_7_2;Professor Mutenstein's famous campaign opening speech! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_7_3;Do you support him, Missy? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_7_4;Not really, but we're here to cover the event, not to give our opinions. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_7_5;You're absolutely right! Here he speaks.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_7_6;My dear friends who made the trip! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_7_7;Fellow citizens of Genetic City! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_7_8;And the viewers watching on their TV screens! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_7_9;Today, I'm officially launching my campaign for mayor of Genetic City. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_7_10;Why, you may ask? Because this big, beautiful city needs renewal. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_7_11;A renewal that, in view of my opponents, only I can embody, and... !
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_7_12;*explosion in the background*
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_7_13;What's going on? We've lost the image on the Professor. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_7_14;I think a mutant seems to have got out of control, and is starting to run amok in the arena. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_7_15;It seems that the Psy-Captains are trying to fight him. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_8_1;The situation seems to be almost back under control, but there's a lot of damage in the arena. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_8_2;Yes, and Professor Mutenstein is nowhere to be found. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_8_3;Where? He's certainly been moved by his security team!
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_8_4;I hope so, it would be a shame for such a promising candidate to disappear.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_8_5;Trevor, no politics on this set! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_8_6;Apparently, we're receiving encrypted transmissions. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_8_7;While our external communications staff deal with this, let's take a look at what's happening in the arena. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_8_8;The Psy-Captains continue to battle the last few remaining aggressive mutants. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_8_9;We'll be back in a few moments. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_9_1;And we're back on set! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_9_2;With some strange news, to say the least.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_9_3;First, the appearance of a large banner in the stadium. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_9_4;You're missing the point: it reads "Mutenstein Assassin!" 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_9_5;Indeed, we were able to decipher the transmission received earlier, and its contents seem edifying!
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_9_6;It's a series of anonymous messages, but in essence, they all say the same thing.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_9_7;And what do they say? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_9_8;That the man responsible for the mess and damage in the arena...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_9_9;is none other than Mutenstein himself! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_9_10;What do you think? Personally, I'd rather not comment on that at the moment. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_9_11;He might be able to do it, but we'll have to conduct our own field investigation, my dear Trevor! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_9_12;Yes, but we'll have to wait for access to the site, which will be cordoned off by the police. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_1_9_13;And all this will of course be covered on our channel, live!

caption_mission_anniversary24_1_13;Urban ran away from his interview, and he needs you to get him to make something. 
caption_mission_anniversary24_1_14;Now that things have calmed down with Urban, he can take on more complex fabrications.

DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_1_2;Good evening Missy! Indeed, this live broadcast will be devoted to an investigation! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_1_3;And not just any investigation! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_1_4;An investigation to determine Professor Mutenstein's responsibility for his meeting! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_1_5;Do you think he's guilty? As far as I'm concerned...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_1_6;Our aim tonight is to get to the bottom of this whole affair. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_1_7;The police investigation was held last week and came to no conclusion. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_1_8;Do you think we'll be able to find any clues that might have been overlooked by the police? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_1_9;Yes, it's possible. However, it's still a dangerous place, and some pretty violent mutants have taken up residence in the damaged stadium.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_1_10;That's why we've got one of the most effective Psy-Captains of his generation on our side! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_2_1;We've just entered the site! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_2_2;And already the fighting is raging, even though it's only relatively weak mutants at the moment. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_2_3;I hadn't paid much attention during our previous live session at the meeting...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_2_4;But I can see that the arena is far more damaged than anything we've come across so far.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_2_5;And yes, between the initial explosion and the mutants gone mad, the damage is pretty extensive! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_2_6;Not to mention the arena's entire infrastructure, which has been seriously weakened. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_2_7;How do you intend to proceed with our investigation, my dear Trevor? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_2_8;I was about to ask you! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_2_9;Yes, but you're the one who won a Pulitzer, not me, so it's up to you to lead the investigation! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_2_10;You're right, Missy, I suggest that we first take a closer look at this arena.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_2_11;Good idea, we might find some clues as to the nature and origin of the damage. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_3_1;So, my dear Trevor, what do these observations tell us? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_3_2;Quite incredible! According to my observations, all this damage was done by mutants! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_3_3;Not one bit of damage was produced by a human being! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_3_4;Can you be more... precise?
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_3_5;Not really, it's difficult to know in detail what happened! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_3_6;And that's why Missy contacted me, Trevor! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_3_7;Darwin? What the hell are you doing here? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_3_8;With my scientific methods of analysis, we'll be able to identify which mutant did what damage.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_3_9;For example, this hole in the ground here was made by a Buffalaur. Probably Mutenstein's bodyguard. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_3_10;Ah, yes, when he confronted the Psy-Captain just as things were getting tumultuous? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_3_11;That's right, Missy. On the other hand, I've got some pretty contradictory readings here....
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_3_12;I'm going to need some time to analyze things. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_3_13;In the meantime, let's split up and search the stadium for clues! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_4_1;Strange, we split up and that's when Missy attacks us!
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_4_2;At the same time, it's not surprising - she's always had a grudge against Mutenstein. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_4_3;Darwin, how are your readings? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_4_4;I have traces that reveal the use of lasers in Missy's mutant form. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_4_5;That's one more clue that Missy could be our culprit! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_4_6;It's still strange, Trevor, Missy would never cause damage to the population!
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_4_7;And yet there's evidence of her involvement, isn't there? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_4_8;Of her involvement, no. Of the use of lasers identical to hers. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_4_9;It's still the same thing! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_4_10;Not quite, Trevor, you're being a little too... hasty in your conclusions! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_4_11;What the kid's trying to say is that Mutenstein himself installed these lasers in Missy! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_4_12;So we'd have to contact Mutenstein to find out if he'd done it to others. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_4_13;And that's something he'd never admit publicly.  
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_4_14;So let's find Missy before someone else does! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_5_1;Ah! I've been looking for you! Here, you came too, Urban?
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_5_2;Missy! We've got plenty of evidence against you, so... just give it up! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_5_3;Uh... can someone explain to me why Super Detective's accusing me? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_5_4;We found traces of your lasers inside and outside the arena! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_5_5;Yes, of course, after we cut the antenna, I helped out by fighting off a few mutants. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_5_6;To protect the civilians and get them out of the building safely! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_5_7;And before that, I was on air while you were walking around doing your interviews. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_5_8;So, it can't be Missy...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_5_9;No, and I'm pretty disappointed to see that you, Reed, are trying to falsely accuse me. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_5_10;There were some pretty good arguments against you... and you attacked us! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_5_11;WHAT? I was in a side room just before! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_5_12;And yet you attacked us in your mutant form, with your lasers and everything! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_5_13;So someone's impersonating me... be careful! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_6_1;Another one of those mutants Mutenstein created for his campaign...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_6_2;You think they had something to do with this story? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_6_3;When Mutenstein is involved, no mutant can be trusted! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_6_4;I tend to agree with Missy! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_6_5;Eva? I thought you weren't supposed to come and stay with Mutenstein to report our findings! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_6_6;It was Mutenstein himself who asked me to come and see where you were! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_6_7;But it's not stupid what you were saying about the mutants he himself created for his campaign. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_6_8;It certainly sounds like him. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_6_9;Now that everyone's here, let's make several groups of 2, so we don't get caught. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_6_10;Darwin, stay with the Psy-Captain; Urban, keep an eye on Missy; and finally, Trevor and I! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_6_11;Are you two going to be all right? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_6_12;We'll be careful, and the stadium doesn't have such huge corridors, so it's pretty easy to avoid the mutants! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_7_1;I don't understand a thing! First Missy, now Reed! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_7_2;What's going on here? What's the status of this investigation? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_7_3;Professor Mutenstein! The investigation is at a standstill, and it seems that several of our friends may be guilty. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_7_4;Including Reed in a rather strange mutant form! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_7_5;Ah... yes, Reed's famous parachronic mutant form... It doesn't make sense! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_7_6;Unless... Reed has altered the timeline more profoundly than he let on? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_7_7;It's possible... But highly improbable. It's hard enough for him to hold a pen properly. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_7_8;But he'd have everything to gain and possibly a second Pulitzer around this mystery...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_7_9;Yes, but then no one would have to be able to prove that he was responsible. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_7_10;And given how clumsy he is, he wouldn't be able to divert anyone's attention. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_7_11;Or on the contrary, like now, attention would be focused on him! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_7_12;Let's go and find him before he goes after Eva! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_8_1;No Eva, but a bound and gagged Trevor...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_8_2;I really wasn't expecting that... Would she really be capable of that? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_8_3;No, she's not the type. On the other hand, I'm beginning to understand. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_8_4;You think you've found a solution to this case? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_8_5;I might have. We've seen a fake Missy, a fake Trevor, and maybe... a fake Eva. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_8_6;So you think...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_8_7;Exactly! The mutant is probably a shape-shifter. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_8_8;And he may have replaced us in some of our conversations during this investigation. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_8_9;Leaving him a chance to escape while we explained all our plans to him! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_8_10;I've cobbled together a device that should force him to appear in his true form if we come across him. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_8_11;However, it takes a little time to calibrate, and it's possible he'll try to change form. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_8_12;Psy-Captain, I'm counting on you to hold him back for as long as necessary and defeat him once he's stabilized! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_9_1;Professor Mutenstein, we've solved the mystery! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_9_2;This whole affair was caused by a mutant shape-shifter capable of replicating mutants as well as humans!
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_9_3;But how? But I've never worked on such a mutant in my laboratories...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_9_4;Unless... No, it couldn't be that...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_9_5;Any comment for our live feed, Professor? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_9_6;No comment on this story, Trevor. The situation is more problematic than I thought.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_9_7;But if this kind of mutant starts appearing, it's extremely dangerous...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_9_8;Imagine being replaced by a mutant who looks exactly like you! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_9_9;This was one of the things I intended to denounce at my meeting. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_9_10;You don't mind if I write an article about the whole thing, do you, Professor? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_9_11;Just learn how to hold a pen, Trevor. No problem. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary24_2_9_12;As for the four of you, I'll see you soon. I've got some specific things to ask you.

This codex has been completed at various times, and each civilization has attempted to reappropriate the creation method, adapting it to its own culture and belief systems.

DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_1_1;Hi Eva! Hi Darwin! So, you all ready? 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_1_2;Ready for what, Urban? 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_1_3;To go trick-or-treating, get out there, have some fun! 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_1_4;I don't think you've been keeping up with recent events...
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_1_5;What are you talking about? Has something happened again? 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_1_6;Yes, and Mutenstein has to call us... now. 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_1_7;Hello, my dear friends. I see Urban has finally decided to join us. 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_1_8;As you may have noticed, there's been an upsurge of various animals. 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_1_9;Ah, it wasn't just a brand-organized thing, all the critters?
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_1_10;No, it wasn't. That's why I'd like you to investigate the situation. 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_1_11;Such a pest invasion could prove... detrimental to my campaign. 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_1_12;Okay, so it's down to us to do the dirty work. Psy-Captain, let's go! 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_1_13;Wait for us, we're not even ready to leave yet! 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_2_1;As Mutenstein said, there's quite a concentration of pests here.
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_2_2;I'll call him immediately, now that we're here. 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_2_3;Ah, I see you've moved relatively quickly. 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_2_4;We can't let this problem drag on, Mutenstein. 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_2_5;People are in a panic over the bugs! 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_2_6;Ah, yes, the people, always the people. Well, you see the extent of the problem. 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_2_7;I need you to take care of it as soon as possible, so I can get back to my campaign. 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_2_8;Good luck! 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_2_9;As amiable as ever, Father Mutenstein...
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_2_10;He's not going to change suddenly to please you either! 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_2_11;Besides, if he doesn't change, couldn't he... 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_2_12;You think he's connected to the proliferation of bugs? 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_2_13;It could totally be his style. Either way, we've got to get rid of him. 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_2_14;Psy-Captain and Darwin, take care of this side, we'll meet up later. 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_3_1;Ahhhh help! Help! 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_3_2;What are you doing here, Trevor? In the middle of the bugs? 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_3_3;I was sent to report live... 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_3_4;But there's bugs everywhere, it's swarming, it's horrible! 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_3_5;Stay with us, we'll clean up and try to figure out what's causing the problem. 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_3_6;You'll get a good report out of it! 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_3_7;You're right! Psy-Captain, try not to get too close to the camera.
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_3_8;It's hard to film intense mutant battles otherwise. 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_3_9;REED! We're not your assistants either. We're here to help with the problem.
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_3_10;So your considerations of camera or info quality are SECONDARY! 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_4_1;Bugs are more aggressive around here. 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_4_2;Yet my electromagnetic detector doesn't pick up any devices or the like. 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_4_3;So either Mutenstein has found a new method, or he's innocent. 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_4_4;In any case, if the bugs are more aggressive, it's probably because they're guarding something. 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_4_5;Treasure? 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_4_6;More like a queen, or a leader of some kind.
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_4_7;A queen of so many insectoid mutants and various pests? 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_4_8;It wouldn't be the first time. After all, mutants react to psychic impulses. 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_4_9;So if there's some kind of hive mind...
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_4_10;We've got to get rid of the main creature and get the others out of the way! 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_4_11;Psy-Captain, we're on the final stretch! 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_5_1;How awful. What was that thing? 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_5_2;It was like something half-scorpion, half-scolopendar! 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_5_3;Was anyone hurt? Or splashed with venom? 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_5_4;I don't think so, everyone was a bit far away during the fight. 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_5_5;I'll get a sample for the lab just in case. 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_5_6;Darwin, don't experiment with that... We're not going to ravage the town! 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_5_7;Ah, Mutenstein calls us just after the battle...
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_5_8;Well done! Bravo! I can see that everything is starting to return to normal. 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_5_9;The insects are starting to disperse now that we've eliminated the enormous monstrosity. 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_5_10;Monstrosity? Do you have any images for me? 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_5_11;Don't worry, I'll send them to you, Professor.
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_5_12;I'll leave you to it, I'm going to study these pictures. 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_5_13;REED! Why did you send him the pictures? We don't even know if he's connected to the problem! 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_5_14;Information has to flow, Eva, I'm not responsible for what people do with it. 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_5_15;Well, now that everything's calmed down.... Are you ready for the big Halloween party? 
DialogPVE_Event_halloween24_5_16;Really, Urban, when everyone's so exhausted? I guess we've earned it, this party!

caption_mission_halloween24_10;In extreme cases, there's no choice. We need heavy artillery. 
caption_mission_halloween24_11;Let's try to make something that will help us with this invasion.

caption_mission_halloween24_13;A good solution against bugs: create predators.

DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_1_1;Here we are at last! I hope you've all already planned what to do? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_1_2;I'm off to the cocktail bar! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_1_3;I think I'll sunbathe on the beach. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_1_4;What about you, Darwin? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_1_5;I'll probably help the Psy-Captain get ready. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_1_6;I saw there was a friendly tournament this afternoon, so we'll get the mutants ready.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_1_7;Darwin, I thought you were going to take it easy on this vacation! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_1_8;It's different here, Eva, I do it for pleasure, not obligation! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_1_9;Don't fight, just enjoy! If Darwin wants to enter the tournament, let him. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_1_10;Yes, that's right, no stress, we're here all expenses paid by Mutenstein...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_1_11;So we might as well go all out! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_2_1;Good news Psy-Captain, your results are excellent, and you've qualified us for the next stage. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_2_2;From what I hear, you should have quite a few mechanized opponents.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_2_3;So, warriors, how's it going? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_2_4;Better than expected, Missy. The Psy-Captain's qualified, and I was giving him a heads-up. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_2_5;How about yourself? No more sunbathing? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_2_6;Yes, the sun's already setting, and it's not looking good for my complexion.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_2_7;I'm going to come and watch your fights, because that's where you can see the fireworks best. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_2_8;There's one every evening, at dusk. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_2_9;And I wouldn't miss it for the world. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_2_10;So stay with us, we'll be spending a lot of time on the outdoor arena!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_3_1;That fireworks display was truly magical! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_3_2;Yes, it's the most beautiful I've seen since I was a little girl! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_3_3;Apparently, that's the conclusion of tonight's events. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_3_4;Yes, but tomorrow there's a big mixology show at the cocktail bar. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_3_5;With the world's greatest mixologist, who is said to be a mutant.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_3_6;On the other hand, it's after the rest of the tournament, so we need to get to bed early tonight. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_3_7;To do that, we'll have to get our hands on Urban, who's off somewhere again...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_3_8;Leave him alone, he'll find his room on his own. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_3_9;And you, Psy-Captain, I want you in top form for the rest of the tournament! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_4_1;Frankly, you could have been a bit cooler with the mixologist. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_4_2;After all, who advised him to take on the Psy-Captain? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_4_3;Er... I think it was me, but I have my doubts. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_4_4;Given your condition, it's not surprising you don't remember. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_4_5;I sincerely hope they don't make us pay for it. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_4_6;Yes, I think even the 5 of us might not have enough money to pay for the damage...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_4_7;The tournament displays have changed! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_4_8;How come? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_4_9;Instead of just having normal fights, the security forces will be taking part.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_4_10;It's better than having to fight them on their own turf! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_4_11;Psy-Captain, this is your chance to keep us out of trouble!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_5_1;A computer security robot destroyed! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_5_2;And a call from Mutenstein to boot! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_5_3;So, how are you enjoying your little vacation, my young friends? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_5_4;Quite well, Professor - we've just won a tournament there! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_5_5;And Urban has tried every cocktail on the menu!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_5_6;It's really MA-GIC! And I doubted your intentions...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_1_5_7;I also have to admit that nothing problematic happened.

DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_1_1;Ever since Gérard Steelgarden's show, I've had the feeling that something was wrong. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_1_2;I'm glad to hear you say that, because at first I thought it was just visual effects...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_1_3;Since we're still seeing this ambient, persistent purple...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_1_4;I'm inclined to think it's likely to persist for a while. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_1_5;Let's go and see what's going on outside, there seems to be quite a massive gathering. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_1_6;It's strange, a lot of people are taking photos from the heights... 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_1_7;We'd better go and see what's going on...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_1_8;Let's go to the arena level, where we'll get the best view! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_1_9;Good idea Darwin, but there seems to be fighting going on, so let's be careful...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_1_10;Wouahhhh!!! It's so beautiful! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_1_11;No time to chat, there are mutants coming our way. Psy-Captain! Get ready! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_2_1;Darwin, Urban, do you have an explanation for this phenomenon? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_2_2;From a scientific point of view... I would say that....
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_2_3;You'd say you don't know. It's just another big weird magic thing...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_2_4;Let's call Mutenstein and find out! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_2_5;Do you really want to trust him? After what he's put us through this year?  
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_2_6;No, but he might know something! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_2_7;Yes, or he sent us here on purpose...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_2_8;Do you think he sent us here knowing that this kind of phenomenon was going to happen? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_2_9;Would you be surprised if he did? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_2_10;No, but in any case, if we want to call him, we'll have to use a landline.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_2_11;What do you mean? Ah, yes, my phone's out of order too.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_3_1;And good evening everyone, I'm currently live from the Sunset Resort where an absolutely unknown phenomenon is taking place! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_3_2;The sky is a purplish hue, covered in strange symbols, and there are similar symbols on the ground. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_3_3;Could this be an exceptional phenomenon, or an act perpetrated by local residents? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_3_4;Find out more in our next exclusive newsletter! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_3_5;REED! What the hell are you doing here? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_3_6;I've been dispatched to cover Gerard Steelgarden's final performance...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_3_7;It's been over for a while. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_3_8;Yes, my plane was greatly delayed by a rather strange area of turbulence and a pressurization problem...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_3_9;So you've seen some strange colors and deformations? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_3_10;Exactly! Which airline did you take to get here? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_3_11;It's got nothing to do with that, Reed. You'd think it had something to do with that HUGE mystical circle around the Sun...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_3_12;And it's spewing mutants on a loop that we're trying to contain on a loop...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_3_13;Help! Psy-Captain, you've got to protect me! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_4_1;Things are a little calmer. Darwin, get in touch with Mutenstein right away! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_4_2;I'm already doing it, but the connection's a bitch...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_4_3;Good evening to you all. I was expecting your call sooner...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_4_4;I thought you might. You knew what was going to happen! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_4_5;I didn't know exactly, but I was able to predict certain risks. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_4_6;So you admit you sent us there to get rid of us...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_4_7;No, I didn't. I knew that your little team would be the most suitable if my fears were well-founded. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_4_8;From the research I've been able to do, the veil of reality could be broken in several places.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_4_9;I've read about it. Do you think other dimensions are trying to link up with ours? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_4_10;From the few images I've seen, it looks more like a spill. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_4_11;All the energy of this other dimension pressing against the border with the aim of overwhelming us. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_4_12;In other words: do everything you can to find the creatures at the source. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_5_1;Old Mutenstein is very kind with his indications, but creatures are coming from everywhere. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_5_2;Shouldn't we concentrate a little more on that big glyph on the ground?
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_5_3;After all, it looks a lot like the one that appears in the air around the setting sun. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_5_4;For once, I'm willing to believe you, Reed. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_5_5;Yes, admittedly, drawing the parallel wasn't the most difficult thing to do either.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_5_6;Yes, but for once he's proposing something relevant instead of running away....
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_5_7;Surely, when you look at it like that, it's a clear step forward. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_5_8;Let's not waste any more time, and look for clues around this giant glyph. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_5_9;Psy-Captain, meanwhile, take care of the twilight mutants. Especially the big ones. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_6_1;A few more high-profile enemies, and the glyphs still haven't diminished. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_6_2;In fact, according to my indicators, the opposite is true: they seem to have increased in intensity. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_6_3;What do you mean? Did we do all this for nothing? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_6_4;No, but I have the impression that this was part of their process. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_6_5;Making sure we confront the leaders, to activate every single glype in their giant circle. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_6_6;So there's nothing we can do about it? That's terrible! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_6_7;On the contrary, I think we can do something about it.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_6_8;This giant circle must allow the passage of an entity far more powerful than the previous ones.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_6_9;And this is the one we have to stop at all costs. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_6_10;All the others were designed to exhaust us.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_6_11;So that we can't face the last one with all our strength, and lose miserably. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_6_12;We're not going to let that happen. Psy-Captain, you lead the way for the final assault! 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_7_1;The giant circle has started to dissipate since we defeated that mutant.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_7_2;I'd hoped it would disappear instantly, but I suppose that's to be expected.
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_7_3;According to the readings, yes, there's a significant magic overload, but it's diminishing. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_7_4;So you're confirming that everything's going to get better? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_7_5;Absolutely. The power level is dropping rapidly...
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_7_6;But...? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_7_7;But it may take a few hours or even days for everything to return to normal. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_7_8;That bad? And we don't risk any consequences? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_7_9;Unfortunately, only time will tell. I'll run some tests when we get back. 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_7_10;Because you're not planning to return right away? 
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_7_11;You're kidding, Reed! I've still got half the cocktails to test!
DialogPVE_Event_xmas24_2_7_12;And I intend to make the most of this vacation too!

Specimen_FD_14;Vanir Queen Freyja
caption_specimen_fd_14;As part of an exploration commissioned by Mutenstein, Eva and Urban arrived in a dimension and temporality close to the Viking era, but ruled by deity-bound mutants. After defeating it, some archaeological treasures were brought back by the group in order to study Viking civilization in detail beyond the known residual texts, and they were able to recover fragments of this mutant's DNA from these artifacts so they could verify the nature of these mutants.

DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_1_1;My dear friends, in the name of science, I wish you good luck! 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_1_2;Frankly, Mutenstein, did we REALLY have to take part in this program? 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_1_3;As I explained to you earlier, this is an incredible archaeological and anthropological possibility. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_1_4;A dimension in which mutants would have come into contact with the world and taken control of it...
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_1_5;Isn't that fascinating? 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_1_6;I'd say creepy rather than fascinating... But I suppose we have no choice? 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_1_7;Not really, at least not until after the election. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_1_8;I like the outfit I was able to try on, but I have to admit it's not very practical. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_1_9;These outfits are only there to facilitate your interactions if need be. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_1_10;But it's better if we don't interact, so as not to create problems. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_1_11;As for the Psy-Captain, he'll stay with you as backup, to keep you out of trouble. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_1_12;Scandinavian forests can be merciless at this time of year...
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_2_1;Darwin? Darwin? Do you copy? 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_2_2;Not particularly well, but it'll have to do. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_2_3;The Professor has confirmed that you can transfer mutants from Genetic City without too much trouble.
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_2_4;However, transporting humans is rather... energy-intensive.
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_2_5;And this despite the fact that humans are significantly smaller than mutants.
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_2_6;We found a completely deserted village, although a lot of things still seem to be in working order. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_2_7;How interesting! But no one in the village? 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_2_8;No, apart from the mutants, and some kind of large boar that emitted greenish energy...
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_2_9;I'll look into it, try to stay on the lookout. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_2_10;Don't worry about that, especially if we can't get in easily. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_3_1;Eva? Urban? Psy-Captain?  
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_3_2;Ah, finally some news, I was beginning to think you were planning to leave us behind. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_3_3;Not at all, Eva, but I was a little... focused on my research. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_3_4;So, what did you find for us? 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_3_5;Apparently, the boar you fought could be some kind of divine familiar. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_3_6;Divine? Like, connected to deities? I don't think so. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_3_7;It would be connected to the Divine Twins, Freyja and Freyr. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_3_8;You might run into a big blue feline if that's what I think. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_3_9;Are we? He's just been defeated by the Psy-Captain! 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_3_10;Did he really? That's both good and bad news. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_3_11;It probably means you'll soon be facing those famous twins the legends speak of. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_3_12;And do you have any ideas about their abilities? We could use some. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_3_13;It seems that Freyr has abilities of the solzzrrts order....
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_3_14;It's limited information, but we'll have to make the best of it... Let's go, Psy-Captain! 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_4_1;Your power is unusual, Warriors. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_4_2;And your outfits lead me to believe that you come from far away. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_4_3;You can't be wrong. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_4_4;How do you understand our language? 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_4_5;It's the power of the Vanir, which grants us the ability to understand the dialects of weak beings. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_4_6;Weak? Let me remind you that we beat you to the punch. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_4_7;My power is limited compared to that of my sister, the queen of us all.
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_4_8;In other words, we have no choice but to face her?
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_4_9;If you want to prove yourself and get away scot-free, I'm afraid so. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_4_10;I respect your strength and won't stand in your way during your fight. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_4_11;It's too much of an honor... but I'd much rather not have to fight. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_4_12;It's part of our tradition. And I suppose you prefer that to a summary execution. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_4_13;Seen from this angle... Psy-Captain, we'll prepare as usual, and it'll be child's play! 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_5_1;Ah, the famous travelers who defeated my little brother...
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_5_2;We're twins, I remind you. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_5_3;You're still the little brother among us, Freyr. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_5_4;Well, we won't stand by and watch you argue for ever! 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_5_5;Urban's a bit blunt, but he's right. We're only here to explore and analyze. 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_5_6;We're not here to fight, although it's nice and warm in this climate! 
DialogPVE_Event_valentines25_5_7;We're looking for various objects to better understand your culture.

DialogPVE_Event_easter25_1_1;In just a few days, a strange black tower decorated with luminescent neon lights has emerged. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_1_2;And right in the middle of Genetic City! Could this be a new promotional campaign? 
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_1_3;Wow, wow, wow! What's this all about?
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_1_4;Haven't you heard, Darwin? There's a huge tower being built right in the middle of town! 
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_1_5;No, I haven't heard anything about it, I haven't left the lab for a few days to work on a new project. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_1_6;In fact, I should take a break, I haven't slept for at least 30 hours straight! 
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_1_7;Anyway, it's really strange, and I think we should at least take a look at it. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_1_8;Could it be related to a new Mutenstein affair? 
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_1_9;Exactly. Plus, it's his style, and his colors. Remember the pyramid in the desert...
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_1_10;Still, it gives me a feeling... Distinct. I can't explain it. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_1_11;It's true that you know this old fool's tech a little better, Missy...
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_1_12;Anyway, we're off now, Darwin, join us when you've recovered.
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_2_1;So... A black tower. Huge. Packed with cybernetic technology...
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_2_2;And filled with particularly aggressive mutant rabbits.
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_2_3;The kind of mystery I'd normally enjoy, but here...
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_2_4;Too sudden for you? Too strange? 
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_2_5;Yes. And it doesn't look like a classic Mutenstein plan.
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_2_6;Which implies that we may have a new enemy waiting for us at the end. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_2_7;An enemy who could play with us by looking like Mutenstein? 
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_2_8;Mostly, I think there are bunnies, tech, and we need to clean up our act. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_2_9;Psy-Captain, let's go, we'll clean the next floors faster together!
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_3_1;Ah! Darwin at last? I thought you'd have slept longer!
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_3_2;When the town's in danger...
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_3_3;Don't give us any big words, kid. You just couldn't sleep. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_3_4;Yeah, that's been bothering me. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_3_5;And when I joined you, I took a little time to look around.
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_3_6;And I have the impression that all the technology in the tower was made by one and the same manufacturer. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_3_7;How can you be so sure? Do you have something to show us? 
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_3_8;Yes, take a look. On every element, whether construction or decoration, you'll find the same 3 letters. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_3_9;B. U. N., followed by an alphanumeric code. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_3_10;So you think it's linked to the person who developed the tower and its technology? 
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_3_11;It's hard to think otherwise. On the other hand, it's the first time I've seen this acronym. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_3_12;So we'll have to keep climbing. Meanwhile, Darwin, try to research the acronym in the meanwhile.
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_4_1;Always rabbits, always this futuristic tech marked with this acronym B.U.N.
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_4_2;And unfortunately, still no answers. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_4_3;I've used 5 search engines and 3 different AIs, but no satisfactory answer. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_4_4;It's as if this thing had never existed before. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_4_5;Which is all the more bizarre, given the speed with which they built the tower. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_4_6;Unless it's some new technology not yet publicly announced...
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_4_7;But it doesn't add up, there should be patents or an official government agreement.
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_4_8;And there's nothing about that right now. Not even a construction permit for this building! 
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_4_9;Wait, you mean this building isn't listed anywhere? 
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_4_10;Nowhere. And no company has that pink rabbit-head logo either!
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_4_11;As we approach the top of the tower, I'd like to think we're going to run into the leader of this operation!
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_5_1;A cybernetic rabbit capable of high-speed teleportation...
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_5_2;If someone had ever told me I'd see this with my own eyes, I wouldn't have believed it...
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_5_3;And it too seemed to have the acronym B.U.N. engraved on its chassis...
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_5_4;Er... is it just me, or is the building starting to rock? 
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_5_5;No, no, I think it was the central unit holding everything in place. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_5_6;Which means...? 
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_5_7;We'd better get down there as soon as possible before the whole thing collapses! 
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_5_8;But we won't be able to study anything if we leave! 
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_5_9;And you won't be able to study anything if you end up in the ruins of the building! 
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_5_10;I'll take the robot's central chip, maybe we'll get something out of it. 
DialogPVE_Event_easter25_5_11;Good idea, but hurry up, we're running out of time!

DialogPVE_storypatch_2_1_1;Ah, Darwin, I've been looking for you! 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_1_2;What's the matter, Eva? You seem... in a hurry. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_1_3;I wanted to know, when do you think you'll finish repairing the medlabs?
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_1_4;Medlabs? I'm just finalizing the tests. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_1_5;I thought they were perfectly functional? 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_1_6;On paper, they are. But misuse produced mutagenic fluids instead of medical fluids. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_1_7;Ah, that was the problem! Now I understand your caution. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_1_8;Yes, we had a few problems during the technical trials, but I've had a bit of help in the meantime. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_1_9;So why don't you ask the Psy-Captain for a hand to finish things off more quickly?  
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_1_10;Not a bad idea, and it could lead to a small reward!
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_2_1;Good news, Eva, the fluid tests have been validated
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_2_2;We'll be able to resume work shortly. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_2_3;That's great, but I hope you haven't upset your equipment.
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_2_4;If in doubt, we'll do another quick calibration. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_2_5;It shouldn't take too long with the help of the Psy-Captain.
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_2_6;Let's get to work quickly, I'm going to need quite a few samples. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_2_7;What kind of samples? I thought this was a simple calibration? 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_2_8;Yes, we need to recalibrate each of the genes in the machine.
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_2_9;And they need to be recalibrated both individually and collectively.
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_2_10;Good luck to you both, and I'll go and see what Urban is up to in his lab.
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_3_1;The calibration is fine, so it's time to test the medical labs. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_3_2;It took longer than expected. Are you sure everything's okay? 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_3_3;Yes, we had to do a double calibration on certain genes. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_3_4;How's that done? You don't usually need to do that, do you?
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_3_5;You're the one who asked me to recalibrate the machine properly. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_3_6;We usually have a margin of error, and recalibrating forced me to reduce it. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_3_7;But it should also produce fewer errors as a result of this change. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_3_8;So, can we test it or not yet? 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_3_9;Yes, we'll be able to test it right away, I just have one last tiny test to do. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_3_10;Hurry up, Darwin, our friend the Psy-Captain is getting impatient.
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_4_1;Mr. Darwin, it looks like the medipacks are up and running. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_4_2;Good news then...  
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_4_3;But there's a problem: the silver ion content of the solution is dropping extremely rapidly. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_4_4;What can we do to solve this problem? 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_4_5;It might be a good idea to ask your colleague to supply us with sufficiently pure silver.
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_4_6;Yes, that might be enough to feed the machine to make new medipacks. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_4_7;I see, we could have a kind of self-powered system that way. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_4_8;Darwin, why are there mutants loose in your lab? 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_4_9;These are my two new assistants, they specialize in the medical field. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_4_10;Well, while I'm defusing the situation with Eva, run a few more tests!
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_5_1;Darwin! You could have warned me before embarking on this project. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_5_2;Especially with mutants as assistants! 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_5_3;Not a very rewarding term, by the way.
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_5_4;So, you two, now's not the time. We'll talk later, but right now I'm on the Darwin case. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_5_5;But Eva, you're the one who asked me to fix the medical labs as soon as possible. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_5_6;Yes, and I expected you to do it quickly and efficiently. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_5_7;And that's exactly what I did. But when I hit a wall, I chose efficiency. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_5_8;You chose to take extra risks, mostly. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_5_9;Maybe, but calling in mutants who specialize in mutant medicine made sense. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_5_10;Anyway, Psy-Captain, you should go and see Urban in his lab, he's got some stuff for you.
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_6_1;Now that we've finished testing the new medipacks in the Black Hole, let's get back to Eva. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_6_2;The good news is that Eva has finally calmed down. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_6_3;The bad news is that she caused some damage in the lab by throwing things at me. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_6_4;At least you seem to be in one piece... even intact. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_6_5;Yes, I took cover, and that's why she caused the damage. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_6_6;Is there much to repair? 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_6_7;It's hard to say, but I have a feeling we're going to need to go through your lab to tinker.
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_6_8;So there's real damage, if I understand correctly. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_6_9;At least we know for sure that everything's working on my end, we've just been doing some tests. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_6_10;The sooner we get the components, the sooner we'll be ready.
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_7_1;It's okay, everything's fixed. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_7_2;Everything's fixed on your side, and Urban's is working too...
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_7_3;Maybe now we can get back to business as usual! 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_7_4;Why are you in such a state, Eva? 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_7_5;Because I promised Reed and Missy an interview when the medical labs came back! 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_7_6;And given the time it's taken, chances are it's become a minor topic! 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_7_7;I didn't know you were so keen on interviews and cameras...
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_7_8;It's true that you didn't get to know her much before she became a coach. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_7_9;But Eva has always been a very media-friendly person. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_7_10;Speaking of coaching... Psy-Captain, you're late for part of your training.
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_8_1;Well, after that hard workout, you can get some rest. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_8_2;We'll start again tomorrow, and I'm not going to let you go before this interview. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_8_3;Well, there's our Eva again, ready to do anything to make you stronger, Psy-Captain. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_8_4;That's the spirit she had when she was at her best. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_8_5;While she's so motivated, let's make the most of it! 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_8_6;And above all, keep using the medical labs to speed up your training. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_8_7;Especially as she'll be pumped up for tomorrow's interview!
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_8_8;And you need to get better at medical techniques. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_8_9;We'll leave you to it, I've still got some work to do on catching cells. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_8_10;And as for me, I've still got some work to do on identifying complex recipes.
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_9_1;We're live from Eva Destruction HQ, and with me is dear Trevor Reed! 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_9_2;Good evening Missy, good evening Eva, you promised us something new for your team! 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_9_3;Indeed, Trevor, we've reactivated our medical laboratory system. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_9_4;Do you think these will give you the edge over your opponents? 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_9_5;In terms of combat, no, they're there to heal mutants quickly. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_9_6;However, rapid recovery also means more effective training!
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_9_7;And it's this, coupled with the talent of our Psy-Captain, that will lead us to ever-greater victories. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_9_8;Of course, none of this would be possible without the talent of our technical team. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_9_9;Our hybridization and medical technology specialist, Dr. Darwin. 
DialogPVE_storypatch_2_9_10;And my former rival, who has chosen to work with us on object synthesis methods!

DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_1_1;Darwin, did you see what happened on TV? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_1_2;You mean Missy getting all worked up on prime time?  
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_1_3;Yeah, she was acting kind of... Over the top. It was weird.  
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_1_4;You think so? That kind of behavior on set is pretty typical of her, though.   
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_1_5;It's not just that. It was also unusual because of the theme of the show.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_1_6;It was about the emotional outbursts that have been happening in town over the last few days. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_1_7;I'd be very surprised. And like I said, it's totally her style.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_1_8;Still, we'd better take a look and see how Urban is doing while we're at it.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_1_9;Why not? After all, he almost choked on his laughter. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_1_10;Let's go, Psy-Captain. With everything that's going on, it's likely to be a bumpy ride!
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_2_1;Urban, are you there? We haven't seen you in the lab for two weeks! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_2_2;I'm here, I just took a little break to refocus. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_2_3;Did you see the show with Missy about emotional outbursts? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_2_4;Yes, and apparently it wasn't expensive to produce! Hahaha! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_2_5;I see you haven't lost your sense of humor during these two weeks! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_2_6;No, I've never felt better! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_2_7;Your eyes are shining, Urban...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_2_8;Yes, that's because I'm particularly happy to see you! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_2_9;No, Urban, what we're saying is that your eyes are glowing! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_2_10;So I think it's time to share all this good cheer with you! Hahaha! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_3_1;Ouch! Ouch! My head... How long have you been there? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_3_2;Since you started laughing stupidly and attacking us. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_3_3;You could be a little more careful! We're the ones who have to put up with your mood swings every time! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_3_4;Darwin, calm down, you know he wasn't himself...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_3_5;Exactly! I'm tired of staying calm! Always having to play nice, not rock the boat... 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_3_6;Always having to shut up when others are acting like idiots! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_3_7;Sorry, kid, I had absolutely no control! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_3_8;DON'T. CALL. ME. KID. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_3_9;Psy-Captain, here we go again, the problems are far from solved! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_4_1;There you go! Another one of those weird creatures defeated! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_4_2;Is that it, Darwin? Have you calmed down? Can we move on? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_4_3;I... I think so. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_4_4;You should try to let off steam more often, Darwin. Let loose a little more! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_4_5;Yes, but how? By playing sports? Doing something creative? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_4_6;Eva? Are you okay? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_4_7;Why are you asking me that? What could possibly be wrong? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_4_8;Don't take this the wrong way, but your eyes are shining, and...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_4_9;Shiny eyes? What color? How intense? Is the light constant? Pulsating? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_4_10;Stop asking questions, it makes you look stupid...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_4_11;And why stop? Why not stop those who are satisfied with the answers?  
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_4_12;Psy-Captain, Eva is starting to become dangerous... You'd better be ready! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_5_1;I'm feeling better! I'm feeling better! No more questions! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_5_2;Good, you were becoming unbearable with your incessant questions! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_5_3;Just like you with your jokes, really...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_5_4;Let's call it even then! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_5_5;The emotional tension seems to be easing. The influence of those masked creatures must have gone away. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_5_6;So how do you explain the many mutants who continue to act strangely? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_5_7;Two hypotheses: either there are other masked entities, or there is still an unexplained phenomenon. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_5_8;What kind of phenomenon? I'm having trouble understanding what could trigger all this.  
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_5_9;Potentially something more powerful. What color are the mutants with strange behavior? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_5_10;What does their color matter? Have you decided to take up painting? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_5_11;I need to know to verify my hypothesis. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_5_12;Various colors, but mainly blue, purple, brown, and white. Is that okay?
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_5_13;So none of them are the same color as the three entities that attacked us! Psy-Captain, follow me quickly! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_6_1;We cleaned up, so we should be safe now. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_6_2;Not likely. We haven't encountered any other entities, and the city remains chaotic...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_6_3;I especially feel that by fighting the mutants of other colors... 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_6_4;We've given the reds, greens, and yellows more space. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_6_5;In other words, the three entities have probably joined forces to fight us. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_6_6;We'll have to pull out all the stops if we don't want to fall back under their influence. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_6_7;I don't want to see that frozen face again and ask useless questions! Psy-Captain, lead the way! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_7_1;I think this time it's over. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_7_2;Yes, I see lots of messages on social media saying that the problem is over. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_7_3;I wouldn't be so optimistic if I were you.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_7_4;What makes you say that? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_7_5;I have a bad feeling of déjà vu. A kind of calm before the storm...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_7_6;Plus the fact that Mutenstein hasn't said or done anything since this whole thing started...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_7_7;We should check out City Hall, he should be there. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_7_8;In any case, no answer on the phone, and impossible to leave a message. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_7_9;As if he's refusing all communication...
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_1_7_10;So we have to assume that the mystery is far from over...

DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_1_1;Is it just me, or has the area around City Hall changed? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_1_2;I feel like I'm not really in Genetic City anymore.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_1_3;It's not just the neighborhood. The sky is strange too. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_1_4;I have to admit, that huge colorful whirlwind doesn't inspire any confidence in me... 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_1_5;Let's not waste any time, we have to get our hands on Mutenstein!
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_1_6;Knowing that he's not answering his phone, it'll be harder to triangulate his position.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_1_7;Wouldn't it be enough to just find him at City Hall? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_1_8;Unlikely, he's hardly ever there. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_1_9;In any case, the atmosphere is... sinister. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_1_10;Let's stay on our guard. We may have to fight a lot of mutants. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_2_1;I don't know what you think, but I find the atmosphere around here really terrifying.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_2_2;It's way beyond that! People are screaming, yelling, and running around everywhere! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_2_3;Not to mention that weird purple glow everywhere... 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_2_4;It reminds me of the incarnations.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_2_5;Yeah, only worse... And still no news from Mutenstein! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_2_6;Not to mention that the town hall building is completely locked down.  
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_2_7;Has the old madman barricaded himself in?  
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_2_8;I don't think so, but chances are he's taken off.  
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_2_9;In any case, we can't leave people at the mercy of this madness!  
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_2_10;Psy-Captain, it's time to go back to hunting the mask!  
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_3_1;There you go, one less mask! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_3_2;And one more nuisance... 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_3_3;Ah! You're here too? The mayor isn't answering and I was supposed to interview him! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_3_4;At the same time, you should know that he's hardly ever in his office! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_3_5;I know, I'm so bad at interviews... 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_3_6;Don't take it like that, it's something that can happen to anyone! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_3_7;So I'm just anyone? A mundane and insignificant nobody... 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_3_8;And I was hoping it wouldn't happen again... 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_3_9;It's time to learn the true meaning of the word sadness! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_3_10;Psy-Captain, don't let them get to you! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_4_1;Well! This part of town seems to be in even deeper chaos! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_4_2;Which isn't reassuring at all... 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_4_3;You're NEVER reassured, Trevor. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_4_4;Except when it comes to stupid plans, of course.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_4_5;You think it's always easy to deal with everything related to mutants... 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_4_6;Here in Genetic City, I can't do anything entirely on my own. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_4_7;There you go again, exaggerating! You're the most popular presenter in the whole region! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_4_8;And I would remind you that it would be better not to let ourselves get overwhelmed... 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_4_9;By our emotions? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_4_10;Exactly, we've already seen that the masks can come back... 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_5_1;Finally! Mr. Mayor, I thought we'd never find you! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_5_2;I just wasn't able to answer your questions, Reed. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_5_3;So, what can you tell us about the current situation in Genetic City? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_5_4;It's a pretty unprecedented situation, despite everything the city has already been through. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_5_5;(He should say, “Despite everything I've thrown at this city!”)
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_5_6;And what about the measures you plan to take? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_5_7;The priority will be to clear the streets of these possessed mutants. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_5_8;And to do that, I've called on the best Psy-Captains of their generation. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_5_9;Baron Urban, as well as the protégé of former champion Eva Destruction. Both are extremely talented! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_5_10;Thank you for your time, Mr. Mayor! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_6_1;We fought and defeated each incarnation several times. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_6_2;Everything should certainly return to normal shortly.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_6_3;I'm not so sure. The whirlwind hasn't decreased in intensity at all. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_6_4;Not to mention all those floating rocks... 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_6_5;In my opinion, we're about to face something much more dangerous... 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_6_6;Dangerous! Did you say dangerous? No, anything but dangerous! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_6_7;We're doomed! It's hopeless... 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_6_8;Try to resist, you two! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_6_9;Hahaha! Seeing Reed in tears and Mutenstein terrified is the funniest thing I've seen all day! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_6_10;Calm down! Keep your emotions under control! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_6_11;I feel like I won't last much longer, Psy-Captain! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_6_12;Do something quickly before we're all controlled by the incarnations... But what can we do? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_7_1;Joy.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_7_2;Rage. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_7_3;Surprise.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_7_4;Terror.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_7_5;Despair.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_7_6;I didn't expect you to defeat my servants.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_7_7;Is it just me, or is that voice coming from several directions? 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_7_8;Just like emotions, voices take their own paths. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_7_9;Go away, leave us alone, and leave Genetic City alone! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_7_10;We will continue to fight no matter what your intentions are!  
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_7_11;And I won't let you take this city without a fight, monster! 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_7_12;Since they've bought you some time to prepare, it's time for you to take the stage, Psy-Captain!  
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_8_1;So I accept my defeat. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_8_2;But this battle was just a battle. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_8_3;Not the war. 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_8_4;Good luck in the next clashes.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_8_5;You'll need it.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_8_6;That's right, go away with your masks!
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_8_7;It's no use, Urban, he's already gone.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_8_8;In any case, the whirlwind seems to be dissipating.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_8_9;What he just said is bothering me, though... 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_8_10;Don't worry, it's probably just an empty threat, and if he comes back, we'll kick his butt!
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_8_11;I'd like a second opinion. What do you think, Professor Mut... 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_8_12;Forget it, Darwin, Mutenstein has already left.
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_8_13;Strange, given his insistence on defending the city... 
DialogPVE_Event_anniversary25_2_8_14;As always, we have to expect him to be hiding things from us...
